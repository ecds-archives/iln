Review of Federal Armies at Washington

REVIEW OF FEDERAL ARMIES AT WASHINGTON.
A grand review of the Federal armies under the command of General Grant and General Sherman took place at Washington, before President Johnson, on the 23rd and 24th ult., the army of the Potomac, numbering 75,000 men, being reviewed on the first day, and General Sherman's army, nearly 85,000, on the second. We are indebted to Messrs. Brady and Co., of Washington, for our Illustration of the first day's martial display, in Pennsylvania Avenue, near the White House, with the pavilion, or grand stand, where the President and his Cabinet Ministers, accompanied by some members of the Senate, the Judges, the chief Government officials, and other persons had taken their seats to behold the troops marching past. They had a very imposing appearance, all arms of the service being represented in full force. The occasional introduction of a body of Zouaves served to relieve the sameness. The dark and light blue uniforms gave fine effect to the spectacle, looking up the broad avenue. There was a continuous moving line, as far as the eye could reach, of national, State, division, brigade, regiment, and other flags. Some of them were new, their stars of gold leaf glittering in the sun, and contrasted strongly with the flags tattered in battle or worn to mere shreds. The troops were well clad, and their fine marching elicited praise from every spectator. As the different corps and divisions passed before the President and General Grant, their respective commanders left the column and took seats on the platform. The troops occupied six hours in review, from nine o'clock in the morning until three in the afternoon.
