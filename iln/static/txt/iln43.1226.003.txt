[The New York Herald Says]


The New York Herald says that, in addition to the political parties known as "Copperheads" and "Niggerheads," there is a new faction, with Greeley and Wood for chiefs, known as the "Soreheads." "Greeley is a nigger sorehead, and Ben Wood is a copper sorehead. They ought to be allowed to butt out their brains, if they have any, against each other."
