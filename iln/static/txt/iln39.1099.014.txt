The Long Bridge over the Potomac at Washington
    

This bridge, which connects Washington with the Virginia shore, is a mile long, and about a quarter of a mile of the centre part is built of masonry, with low parapets, and resembles a country road. The remainder of the bridge is of wood. It is sufficiently wide to take three carriages abreast, and has two drawsâ€”one on the Washington and one on the Virginia side. These are nearly always open for the passage of small armed propellers, with which the Potomac swarms. A company of flying artillery is stationed on the bridge every night near the Virginia shore, with the draw raised in front of them. By day the passage across the bridge is unobstructed, and waggons are constantly passing and repassing, although, for form's sake, a company of soldiers is stationed at the extremity of the bridge, and sentinels parade to and fro.
