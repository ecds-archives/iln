               [A Large Number of Envelopes]
               
               A large number of envelopes of letters now used in the Northern States of America have "God Bless the Union!" printed on them. Many have on them also the flag of the United States, the stars and stripes printed in colours, with transverse black stripes to represent the recreant States. Envelopes used in the South have also the Union flag, with the star[s] reduced to the number of the Confederated States.
