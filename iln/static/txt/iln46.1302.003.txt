  [An American Journal Asserts]

An American journal asserts that in the annual report of the chief of the bureau of ordnance of the United States Navy department, it is stated that--"On the field of Gettysburg there were 27,574 guns picked up, and of these 24,000 were found to be loaded, and half of them ware double loaded. One fourth had from three to ten loads in, and many had five or six balls to one charge of powder. In some cases the powder was above the ball, in others the cartridges were not broken at the end, while in one musket twenty-three balls, sixty-two buckshot, and a quantity of powder were all mixed up together."
