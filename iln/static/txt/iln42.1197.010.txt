Artillery and Musketry
 

ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY.--General Rosencranz, in his report of the battle of Murfreesboro', estimates that out of 20,000 cannon-shots fired by the Federals, 728 hit the enemy; and that, out of 2,000,000 musket-shots, 13,832 told. The result of this valuation is that it required 27 cannon-shots or 155 musket-balls to hit one man. Each ball weighing one mean ounce, 9 lb. of metal would be used to kill a man with musketry; and with artillery, 225 lb. of metal would be required for the same purpose; the deaths being in the proportion of 1 to 4 relative to the wounded, 36 lb. of balls, or 900 lb. of iron, would be employed in killing one man.
