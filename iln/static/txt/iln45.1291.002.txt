Peyton Falls, in Virginia

PEYTON FALLS, IN VIRGINIA.
We have engraved on another page a sketch, by an amateur artist, of Peyton Falls, in the AlleghanyAllegheny Mountains, Western Virginia. This romantic and beautiful cascade is on the Falling Spring, a brook tributary to Jackson's River. It is situated in the district or township which was once known as West Augusta, a place remarkable for the courage and patriotism of its inhabitants. This is the place to which Washington referred when he said, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, "Give me but a banner, and I will plant it upon the mountains of West Augusta, and rally around me the men who will raise our bleeding country from the dust and set her free!" Stonewall Jackson, the hero of the present unhappy civil war, as well as many officers of his immortal brigade, was a native of this district. It was near Peyton Falls, indeed, that one of the first battles of the civil war occurred--that of Rich Mountain, in which fell General R. S. Garnett and Colonel John A. Washington. Peyton Falls is the highest cascade or waterfall in America, being 200 ft. in height, while that of Niagara is only 150 ft. The principal stream, however, is only about 10 yards wide at the top and a little more spread at the bottom of the fall. The water is bright and sparkling, and the stream in other parts is full of trout. Near the cascade there is a mineral spring of rare curative properties.
