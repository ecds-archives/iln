LONDON, SATURDAY, MAY 10, 1862
...General M'CIellan had not taken Yorktown at the last advices, but had made an apparently weak attack, which had been attended with no result except the deaths of many brave men. His position does not appear to be an enviable one. It is stated, however, that his avowed enemy, Mr. Stanton, had been compelled by the President to succumb, and that General M'Clellan was to have all the reinforcements that he required. So far as we can judge, he seems to have done as we did in the Crimea—namely, allowed the enemy to choose his own ground, and that the very strongest that exists, and there to fight the great duel. The battle of Pittsburg, which is called by the South the battle of Shiloh, is no longer claimed as a victory by the North, and may be regarded as one of the heaviest items to the credit of the Confederates. We do not perceive much worth setting down in the rumours and probabilities of encounters, and no movement or action of importance is recorded. Meantime, the liberating process is slowly, but it would seem effectually, proceeding; and those in the districts that are to be dealt with who think their slaves worth more than £60 are said to be moving away with those articles of commerce. The visit of M. Mercier to Richmond has given rise to much discussion, and those who know nothing about it affirm with laudable confidence that the Emperor of the French desires to make peace in order to the concluding a treaty by which the Americans and the French shall unite for an attack on England. But the report does not seem to find much credence, and as a sensation paragraph the statement is voted stupid.
