[A Sharper took Passage]


A sharper took passage in an emigrant-ship from Bremen to Baltimore, and, convincing the emigrants that gold was not current in the United States, succeeded in buying with greenbacks nearly all the gold in the possession of the passengers, at a discount of 30 percent. The sharper cleared upwards of 3000 dollars by his rascality.
