[Some months ago the Perthshire]
      

Some months ago the Perthshire, a large colonial vessel of 840 tons, the property of Mr. William Gray, of Hartlepool, was boarded without legal warrant by the United States' steamer Massachusetts, off the American coast, on the alleged ground that the Perthshire had violated the blockade of the Southern ports. The case was represented by the British Minister to the Government at Washington, and Earl Russell has informed the owner that the President will recommend Congress to vote Â£200 as compensation.
