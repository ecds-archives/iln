The New York Sun states that M. Gouraud, Vice-Consul of France for Rhode Island, has made application for a patent for his aerostatic railway, to be worked by atmospheric forces upon inclined planes of wire suspended in the air. It is proposed to apply it to street railways, for crowded thoroughfares in populous cities.
