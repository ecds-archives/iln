[Immigration of Unknown Amount]

Immigration of unknown amount would modify the effect of emigration; but the return of the Emigration Commissioners show that nearly 20,000 persons of English origin left their native shores for distant settlements in the quarter that ended on the 30th of June. Out of that number nearly 12,000 went to the United States, and 5000 to the Australian colonies, The number of emigrants of all nationalities was 86,783, of whom about 66,000, chiefly Irish, were bound to the United States. The emigration to that part of America has not been so great in the June quarter since 1854. Almost nine tenths of the Irish emigrants left for the United States.
