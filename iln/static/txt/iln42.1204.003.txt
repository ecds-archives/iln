Planter's Residence on the Cumbee River, South Carolina


PLANTER'S RESIDENCE
ON THE CUMBEE RIVER, SOUTH CAROLINA.
In describing the sketch from which this Engraving is taken, our correspondent writes:--"Though we are in mid March here, the climate is most temperate and beautiful, resembling very much the warm sunny days of June at home. What the heat will be in the summer time you may readily imagine. After May, however, the planters residing on the river banks remove with their families to the 'pine barrens,' or upper country, the malaria arising from the swamps and rice lands making it dangerous for whites to remain during the hot months in the neighbourhood of the river. The trees to the right of the Engraving are three of the loftiest palmettos I have yet seen. The dwarf plant at their foot is the aloe, which blooms once or twice only in a century."
Our other Engraving, from drawing by the same hand, represents the old negro servants of the planter's family among his children. However repugnant slavery as an institution must be to the English mind, no useful purpose is to be gained by keeping the eyes shut to the undoubted fact that, where the slaves are well treated, many of them grow accustomed to, and happy under, their servitude. This becomes easier when it as recollected that the children of the family grow up among the negro domestic servants, and often learn to regard them with as much affection as they show their own parents.
