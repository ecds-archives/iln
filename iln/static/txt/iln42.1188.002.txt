[Mr. Lincoln has Replied to the Address]


Mr. Lincoln has replied to the address adopted at "the meeting of the working men" held at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, at the close of last year. The President deplores the sufferings to which the cotton famine has given rise, but rejoices at the failure of the efforts of "disloyal American citizens" to induce the operatives on this side of the Atlantic to favour the attempt to establish a Government resting "exclusively on the basis of human slavery." He regards the "decisive utterances" of the gathering presided over by Mr. Abel Heywood "as an instance of sublime Christian heroism, which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country," and he trusts that the sentiments expressed in the address will be sustained by the English nation. He further "hails this interchange of sentiment as an augury that, whatever else may happen, the peace and friendship which now exist between the two nations will be, as it shall be my desire to make them, perpetual."
