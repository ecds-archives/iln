               American Privateering.—The following letter from Lord John Russell to the Lords of the Admiralty was laid before the House of Commons on Monday evening:—"Foreign Office, June 1, 1861. My Lords,—Her Majesty's Government are, as you are aware, desirous of observing the strictest neutrality in the contest which appears to be imminent between the United States and the so-styled Confederate States of North America; and, with the view more effectually to carry out this principle, they propose to interdict the armed ships, and also the privateers of both parties, from carrying prizes made by them into the ports, harbours, roadsteads, or waters of the United Kingdom, or of any of her Majesty's colonies or possessions abroad. I have accordingly to acquaint your Lordships that the Queen has been pleased to direct that orders in conformity with the principles above stated forthwith be addressed to all proper authorities in the United Kingdom, and to her Majesty's naval and other authorities in all quarters beyond the United Kingdom, for their guidance in the circumstances. I have, &c., (Signed) J. Russell." Similar letters have been addressed to the Secretaries of State for India, War, and the Colonies.—The French Government has determined to act on their old law, which is in substance that no privateers can sell their prizes in French ports, or remain there for more than twenty-four hours.
