The Great Falls of the Potomac
   


	  Above Washington the Potomac is obstructed by numerous falls and rapids, around all which canals have been constructed. The Great Falls—of which an Illustration by our Special Artist is given on page 319—are about sixteen miles above the capital, and are occupied on the Maryland side by Union troops and on the Virginian side by Confederates. The skirmishers of both armies are continually "potting" at each other from behind the rocks, though without much damage.
