Colton's Map of the Southern States of America

Colton's Map of the Southern States of America.â€”At this moment this excellent map is necessarily welcome. It is a map of the whole of the Southern States, including Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Lousiana, and Texas, and shows part of adjoining States and Territories locating the forts and military stations of the United States, and all the railroads and railroad stations. It is sufficiently large to give distinctly a mass of detail which could not be included in any ordinary maps, and it is well and clearly engraved. The same publisher (J. H. Colton, New York) has issued a "New Railroad and County Map of the United States, the Canadas, &c.," and a large sheet containing "Plans of the United States' Harbours," showing the position and vicinities of the most important fortifications on the seaboard and in the interior. The maps are obtainable in this country through the agency of Messrs. Letts and Son, of the Royal Exchange.
