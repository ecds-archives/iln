The Water of Saratoga Springs

The Water Of Saratoga Springs.--I took a glass. What was it like? Well, let me see. Say half a pint of very small beer, brewed during a thunder-storm at Brentford, and retained for an unusual period in a chandler's shop in Seven-dials, where the trade wasn't brisk, and the red herrings and the pitchy fire blazers were kept on the top of the cask; then diluted with the water in which cabbages had been boiled, and the drippings of the gingham umbrella, bought secondhand in Vinegar-yard, on a very wet November day: then sent to sea, and allowed to run freely down the lee scuppers; then carefully collected in a hog tub, racked through a cask of turpentine (that came over in a ship otherwise laden with guano and Monte Videan hides, with the horns and hoofs on), mingled with the refuse of a dyeworks, filtered through a gaspipe, to make it sweet and clean, just freshened up--to give it a head--with assaf≈ìtida and jalap, and well stirred up with a brass candlestick, far gone in verdigris. This may give you an imperfect idea of what the water of my first and last spring in Saratoga was like.--G. A. Sala.
