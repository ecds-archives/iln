[The Manchester Guardian States]

The Manchester Guardian states that Captain Semmes, who commanded the Alabama during her eventful career, left Liverpool on Sunday in a ship called the Laurel, which cleared for Nassau, Havannah, and Matamoras. The Laurel's cargo is said to consist of munitions of war, and Captain Semmes is accompanied by eight officers and one hundred men, most of whom, it is alleged, served under him in the Alabama. It is not pretended that the Laurel could act as a cruiser, but the report goes that she will meet, at some convenient point, a new and powerful steamer, called the Ranger, to which she will transfer Captain Semmes and his companions, as well as the stores which she takes out with her.
