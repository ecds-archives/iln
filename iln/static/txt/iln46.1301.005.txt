[A Pleasant Hit]

A pleasant hit at the neck-and-neck race of extravagance which the two powers Shoddy and Petroleum are running in the States is thus made in a paragraph in the New York Tribune:--Mrs. A., accompanied by Mrs. B., recently paid a visit to Tiffany's, and bought there, aided by her friend's counsel, a stylish assortment of jewellery for her own proper wearing. Before they had quite concluded their purchases, a stranger, whom we will call Mrs. C., came in, and, after requiring the services of half the attendants, bought a far more extensive and costly assortment of richly set precious stones, for the adornment of her person. Whereupon: Mrs. A. to Mrs. B. (in an undertone), "Evidently Shoddy." Mrs. C. (overhearing), "No, Madam, Petroleum."--Another story of the same kind is told. A young lady in Pennsylvania informed her lover that the match must be broken off. "Why?" gasped the unfortunate lover. "Dad has struck oil," replied the damsel, determined not to lose her chance of a better match.
