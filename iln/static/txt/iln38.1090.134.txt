               FRONT OF A FIRE-ENGINE HOUSE IN NEW YORK.
               The peculiar constitution of the fire-engine establishments in many of the towns of America, and in New York especially, is tolerably well known. The fire brigades, composed of picked men of the city, are, in fact, well-organised clubs, and their stations are fitted up with reference to the tastes and habits of such associations, and contrast very strikingly with the plain stablelike buildings in which our gallant bodies of firemen with their engines are housed. We gave some little time since in our Journal a Sketch of the interior of one of the fire-brigade stations of New York, showing the kind of place in which the amateur, or rather volunteer, firemen take their ease while on their turn of duty; and our present Sketch shows the exterior of one of the buildings. It is, as may be seen, of some architectural pretension; but its immediate attraction is the numerous placards which have reference to the civil war now unhappily impending.
