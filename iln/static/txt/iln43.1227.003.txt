[The Sandwich Islands]

The Sandwich Islands, According to the Panama Star, are decreasing in population and business. The number of foreign vessels which had arrived at Honolulu during the first half of the present year was less by half than during the corresponding period of last year. There is a great scarcity of labourers for the sugar plantations, and parties are earnestly urging the Government authorities to import coolies from Polynesia. The population of the islands is decreasing more rapidly than at any former period. It is now estimated that they contain only 60,000 inhabitants.
