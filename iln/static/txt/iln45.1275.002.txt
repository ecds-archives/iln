AMERICA.(Per the St. David, vi√¢ Greencastle.)
New York, Aug. 12, Evening.
Official Confederate despatches from Mobile, dated the 8th inst., state:--It is painfully humiliating to announce the shameful surrender of Fort Gaines by Colonel Anderson. Colonel Anderson communicated with the enemy by a flag of truce without the consent of General Page, who inquired, by signal, what his purpose was, but received no answer. General Page telegraphed "hold your fort," and immediately visited Fort Gaines, when he found that Colonel Anderson was on board the Federal fleet, arranging a capitulation. The General left orders for Colonel Anderson, on returning, not to surrender the fort, and relieved him of his command. Fort Morgan signalled this morning, but received no answer except the hoisting of the Federal flag over the ramparts of Fort Gaines. Colonel Anderson's conduct is pronounced inexplicable and shameful.
The Confederates evacuated and blew up Fort Powell on the 7th instant. The whole Confederate fleet, except one vessel, is sunk, beached, or captured.
