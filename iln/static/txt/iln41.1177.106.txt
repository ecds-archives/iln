[At the Washington Post-office]


At the Washington Post-office, among the contents of the mail from the camp there recently came to light on article quite unexpected--a human finger. It had belonged to a soldier, had been amputated after a battle, was dried by the man, and then dispatched by post to a friend. Being inclosed in a newspaper the packet was suspected of being liable to letter postage, and was opened at Washington, and the finger fell out, whether to be restored or sent to the Dead Letter Office is not stated.
