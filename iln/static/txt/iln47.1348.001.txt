[The New York States]

The New York Times states that a second part of Captain Hall's report on his search for fuller information about Sir John Franklin's Arctic expedition has been received. The wrecked ships of Franklin appear to have been visited, the remains of a large number of their crews seen, frozen and mutilated, and the valuables left in the ships appropriated by the Esquimaux. They encourage Captain Hall to believe that some of the men may still be living.
