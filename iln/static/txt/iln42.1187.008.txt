Echoes of the Week.

...The friends of the negro held a "monster" meeting at Exeter Hall last week--so crowded a one that it overflowed the limits of the large hall and filled an oratorical cistern in the basement, and an al fresco tank in Exeter-street. The proceedings were of a most enthusiastic character, and the cause of the North, in connection with that of the abolition of slavery--for which last consummation all good men and true must fervently pray--was energetically advocated. The literary element was represented by Mr. Thomas Hughes, author of "Tom Brown's Schooldays" and "Tom Brown at Oxford," and by Mr. J. M. Ludlow.
