[The Newly-formed Emancipation Society]


The newly-formed Emancipation Society has issued an address, with the object of evoking an unequivocal expression of English feeling in favour of the Federal States of America. The principal object of this society, as explained by its promoters, is to make it everywhere perceived and confessed, by the force of indisputable testimony, that the South is fighting for the preservation of slavery, while the North is fully committed to the destruction of the inhuman system; and they therefore urge that Englishmen should encourage the friends of abolition in America by all the means in their power.
