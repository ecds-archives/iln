[The New Bridge]

The new bridge about to be suspended over the Ohio River at Cincinnati will, the New York Herald states, be the longest structure of the kind in the world, being more than 2000 ft. longer than that over the Niagara River, and 540 ft. longer than the Menai Bridge, England. Its total span will be 1057 ft. The stone piers rise 110 ft. above the floor of the bridge and 200 ft. above their foundations. One year is allowed for building it.
