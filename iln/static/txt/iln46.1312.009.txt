IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.
...HOUSE OF LORDS.--Thursday.
...The Assassination of President Lincoln.
Earl Russell gave notice that on Monday next he would move that a humble address be presented to her Majesty expressing the sorrow and indignation of the House at the assassination of the President of the United States, and praying her Majesty to cause the expression of feeling to be forwarded to the Government of the United States.
The Earl of Derby hoped the noble Earl would ascertain that there was nothing informal in the motion which would render the result in any degree doubtful. With regard to the substance of the matter, he would say that the expression of regret of the nation's sorrow and indignation at the assassination would, in his opinion, not only meet with the unanimous assent of all members of this House, but that it would represent the opinion of every man, woman, and child in her Majesty's dominions (Cheers).
Earl Russell said he thought there would be nothing informal in the motion calculated to give rise to objection to it (Hear, hear).
HOUSE OF COMMONS.--Thursday.
The Assassination Of President Lincoln.
Sir G. Grey said that, in order that the House might have an opportunity of expressing its feelings with reference to the assassination of the President of the United States, he wished to give notice, on the part of his noble friend at the head of the Government, that, on Monday next, he would move an humble address to her Majesty, expressing the feeling of sorrow and indignation with which the House had heard of the perpetration of that atrocious crime, and of sympathy with the Government and people of the United States.
