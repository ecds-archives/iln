[The Rev. Mr. Greene's Congregation]

The Rev. Mr. Greene's congregation in Hatfield, Massachusetts, made their pastor "surprise visits" on Christmas evening and on New-Year's Eve, and left him 508 dols. in money, a barrel of sugar, a barrel of flour, 50 lb. of butter, and wood enough to supply him for a year, besides many other articles for family use. This was in addition to many other valuable presents in money and family supplies during the year. These "surprise visits" would not be taken amiss by many clergymen in this country.
