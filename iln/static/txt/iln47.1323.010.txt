[Sixteen Years Ago]

Sixteen years ago San Francisco was a petty hamlet, lying on the sandy slope that curved its yellow crescent behind Clarke's Point. A few whalers and United States men-of-war had touched there at long intervals, and an occasional merchant vessel had taken aboard a cargo of hides and tallow. The interior was a terra incognita to all except its simple natives and the few travellers and emigrants who had partly explored it. In one year after the discovery of gold had become universally known San Francisco had a population of about 30,000, and its harbour was filled with ships from every quarter of the world. Ten years later its population had more than doubled; and five years later it had nearly doubled again, being hard on to 120,000.
