[A Letter from Calais]


A letter from Calais states that the Confederate vessel the Rappahannock, at present in that port, lately had a judgment pronounced against her by the Chamber of Commerce of Boulogne for commercial debts of the captain. It appears that when the huissier charged to affix the notice of sale made his appearance on board the vessel the captain warned him off without delay, as no such errand should be performed there. The huissier had nothing else to do but retire and draw up a proces-verbal.
