HART ISLAND, NEAR NEW YORK.
Among the signs of returning peace most satisfactory to the observer of affairs in America during the last two or three months was the disbandment, or, as it is there termed, the "mustering out," of the various regiments composing the armies of the United States. One of the stations appointed for this purpose was at Hart Island, situated at the head of Long Island Sound, about twenty miles from the city of New York. Since the early days of the war Hart Island had been used as a general dépôt for recruits, a purpose for which it was admirably adapted by its healthful situation. Our Correspondent visited the place some weeks ago, on the invitation of Captain Barstow, Aide-de-Camp of General Dix's Staff, who was the officer in charge of the arrangements for mustering-out troops at this post, and had a fast-going steamer at his command. The sketch of Hart Island which we have engraved was taken from David's Island, which lies at a short distance from it, and is also a dépôt for troops.
