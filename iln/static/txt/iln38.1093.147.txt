	       MR. ADAMS, UNITED STATES'MINISTER TO ENGLAND.
               Mr. Charles Francis Adams, of Massachusetts, the newly-appointed Minister of the Federal States of America to this country, has peculiar claims to hold this important diplomatic office. His grandfather, Mr. John Adams, who was elected the second President of the United States, on the retirement of Washington in 1797, having been previously Vice-President, was the first Ambassador of that Republic to Great Britain, in 1785; and Mr. John Quincey [sic] Adams, who was President in 1825, and Ambassador to England in 1815—having before that filled a similar office at the Hague, Berlin, and St. Peterburg—was the father of the distinguished gentleman whose individual merits, apart from his hereditary title, have won for him an appointment which, at the present moment, is one not merely of distinction but of great responsibility. All his antecedents are in favour of an opinion as to his entire capability of worthily performing the delicate duties of his office.
               Our Portrait of Mr. Adams is from a photograph by John and Charles Watkins, Parliament-street.
