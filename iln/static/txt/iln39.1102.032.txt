Sketches from Richmond, Virginia
  

On the preceeding [sic] page we give four Engravings (from drawings made by Mr. Lefevre James Cranstone) in connection with Richmond, the chief town of Virginia, where the Southern Congress is now holding its sittings, and which for the time being takes rank as the capital of the Confederate States of America. Richmond is situated on the north bank of the James River, about 150 miles from its mouth. Its chief public building is the State House, or Capitol, which is finely situated in the middle of a lawn, on the brow of a hill which overlooks the city. It is a copy of the Maison Carrée of Nîmes, the plan of which was sent over by Mr. Jefferson, when he was Ambassador in France. The Capitol is a principal feature in the aspect of the city from many points of view. Virginia is justly proud of having given birth to Washington, and statues of him are frequent in the State. Besides the Washington Statue in the Capitol at Richmond there is, in the beautiful park of which the city boasts, an equestrian one of him (given on the preceding page), in company with statues of Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry—all of which were chiselled in Europe at an immense cost.
