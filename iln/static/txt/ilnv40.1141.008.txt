Corinth

Corinth, at which the grand army of the Confederates, under General Beauregard, has taken up a position to oppose the Southern march of the Union forces, is at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio and Memphis and Charleston Railways, in Tishomingo county, 93 miles from Memphis, 40 miles from Grand Junction; 150 miles from Columbus, Kentucky; 58 miles from Jackson, Tennessee, 80 miles from Decatur, Alabama; and about 20 miles in a direct line from Savannah, Tennessee. From Pittsburg the distance to Corinth is about 18 miles, by a good turnpike road. Corinth is an important strategical point. It is situated in a hilly, semi-mountainous country, a branch of the Apalachian range, which diverges from the Alleghany Mountains, and forms the mountains and gold-bearing regions of Georgia and Alabama. The village is nearly surrounded by an irregular circle of hills, rising on the north, about four miles distant, with the State line between Tennessee and Mississippi crossing their summit. The Mobile and Ohio Railway crosses this ridge through a cut 75ft. in depth. Similar cuts, of lesser depth, penetrate the hills on the east, west, and south, where the railways enter. Beyond these hills, in the direction of Pittsburg and Savannah, the ground becomes more level, and much of it is low and swampy.
