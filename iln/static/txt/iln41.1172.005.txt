[Mr. Cobden Addressed a Crowded Meeting]


Mr. Cobden addressed a crowded meeting of his constituents at Rochdale on Wednesday evening. In the course of his speech he made allusion to the distress now existing in Lancashire. This distress, he pointed out, was caused by the blockade of the southern ports of the United States, and that blockade arose from a state of war and the principles recognised in the conduct of war. The Government of the country were assenting parties to those principles, and therefore the distress caused by them was a national matter to be nationally relieved.
