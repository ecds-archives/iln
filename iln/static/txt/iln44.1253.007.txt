Information has been received in London respecting an enormous theft of bar gold, worth £50,000, from the sunken steamer Golden Gate, near San Francisco. The Golden Gate was wrecked in July, 1862, having on board £450,000 worth of gold and specie. The underwriters by whom the vessel had been insured dispatched an agent to the scene of the wreck, and a party of men who recovered about £50,000 worth of bar gold decamped with it. It is believed that most of the booty has been forwarded to London. One of the suspected thieves has been taken into custody.
