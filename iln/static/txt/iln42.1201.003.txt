The Weehawken

THE WEEHAWKEN.
We give an Engraving of the Weehawken, one of the nine Federal iron-clad gun-boats engaged in the recent attack on Charleston. This vessel shows only about sixteen inches above water. Her tower revolves by means of a small engine, and its weight rests on the central shaft, the lower portion of which bears on the keelsons. During action all apertures are shut, ventilation being kept up by two fans, which draw in air from the top of the tower, and the boiler-furnace carries out all foul air. In case of the enemy boarding, the guns may be brought to bear on deck, and hand-grenades thrown from the top of the turret. In the engagement at Charleston the Weehawken acted as pioneer, having attached to her bow an Ericsson raft, intended to lift or explode submarine torpedoes. During the night following the bombardment she lost her raft, which was washed ashore on Morris Island, and taken possession of by the enemy.
