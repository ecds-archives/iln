  Attack on the Pickets of the Garibaldi Guard, East Branch of the Potomac. 
    


Our Special Artist writes as follows respecting the Illustration on the preceding page:â€”"A few nights since I was sleeping in a tent close by the camp of the Garibaldi Guard, when there was an alarm. A party of Secessionists had crossed the river under favor of darkness, and were firing on the pickets. I turned out with the rest, and came up with the supports in time to see the Secessionists retire to the woods. One of the Garibaldi Guard received a bullet wound in his leg. This corps is made up of Germans, Italians, French, and Swiss, with a few Hungarians. Their uniform is a close imitation of the Sardinian bersaglieri."
