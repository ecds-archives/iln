[Two Telegraphic Messages]


Two telegraphic messages, addressed to Mr. Cyrus Field, which left San Francisco June 2, at 9.20 p.m., were brought by the China, which sailed from New York on the morning of the 3rd, and arrived at Queenstown on Friday night. In the first message Mr. M'Clellish, the director of the Colombia telegraph, San Francisco, congratulates Mr. Field on the encouraging prospect of his final effort to lay the Atlantic cable. In the second message Mr. H. W. Carpentier, president of the Overland Telegraph Company, San Francisco, says:--"We congratulate you on the prospect of the early success of your great enterprise. In the meantime we know the shores of the Pacific are not idle. Already we talk to you across an entire continent, as if face to face. Next year I hope will find you in communication with Oregon, Victoria, and British Colombia; another year with Mexico; and three years with London and Paris by way of the Amoor and St. Petersburg." The substance of the above messages was dispatched to St. Petersburg on Saturday morning, having been sent from San Francisco in the Pacific to St. Petersburg on the Neva, in 10½ days, 9½ of which were consumed in traversing the Atlantic by steamer. The messages in question demonstrate that, when an Atlantic cable is successfully laid, St. Petersburg and the great telegraphic system of Russia, reaching almost to the frontiers of China, will be able to communicate with San Francisco and the British possessions on the Pacific within twenty-four hours.
