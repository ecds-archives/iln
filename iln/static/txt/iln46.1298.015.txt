A hopeful miner, writing from Nevada territory, the land of silver bricks, says:--"It is estimated that the silver mines of Nevada will yield this year 25,000,000 dols. This amount will be taken out in two years from now in this city and vicinity annually, as we are now taking out and sending forward 150,000 dols. per month, which will be nearly doubled after the 1st of next January."
