...An Irish American, named Feeny, is actively engaged in Galway in getting labourers for a railroad in the Federal States. He offers eight shillings a day and other advantages to his recruits on arriving at their "destination;" but where that may be is not very clear. He has had great success, and in two or three days enrolled five hundred men. He has been arrested under the Foreign Enlistment Act, in Loughrea, on suspicion of enlisting for the Federal army, but, as no proof could be had, he was acquitted.
Mr. Thomas Highat, a member of the firm of Messrs. Jones and Co., ship-chandlers, Liverpool, was charged before the stipendiary magistrate of that borough, yesterday week, with an offence against the Foreign Enlistment Act. The specific charge against Mr. Highat was that he had been concerned in the enlistment of men for service on board the Confederate cruiser Georgia. The witnesses for the prosecution were four men who served for a short time on board that ship, but who are now employed at a weekly salary by a private detective, who seems to be one of the Attach√©s of the United States Consulate at Liverpool. Mr. Highat was bound over in his own recognizances and two sureties to appear to answer any charge which may be preferred against him at the next Assizes.
