[Despatches Which Had Passed]


Despatches which had passed between the Government of this country and that of the United States have just been published. In a despatch to Mr. Adams, dated May 28, Mr. Seward urges the reasons why this country should not interfere in the war in the States, and sketches tersely and vigorously the position of affairs. This despatch was answered, after a considerable lapse of time, by Earl Russell, who announced that England would still preserve an impartial neutrality, while heartily wishing for a speedy conclusion to the "unnecessary and injurious civil war."
