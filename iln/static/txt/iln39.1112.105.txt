America.—New York, Sept 28.—It is reported from Washington that the Confederates have erected a long line of batteries on the Lower Potomac. Several Federal steamers passing up and down have been fired into. A considerable force of Confederates is assembled between Occoquan and Acquia Creeek [sic].

It is estimated that the Confederates captured at Lexington a million and a half dollars, seven cannon, and 4000 rifles. The Federal troops have stormed and captured Romney, Western Virginia.
