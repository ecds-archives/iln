[The Confederate Steamer Alabama]


The Confederate steamer Alabama put into Bahia on the 12th of May to land prisoners whom she had taken from on board four vessels which she had captured and burnt a few days previously. The number of ships captured by this remarkable privateer was stated by the crew to be seventy-four, which number of chronometers are arranged in Captain Semmes' cabin. The Florida had been at Pernambuco, and had also been committing great havoc on Federal-owned vessels.
