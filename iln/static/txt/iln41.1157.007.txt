Atrocious Act of Piracy

Atrocious Act Of Piracy.--The secretary at Lloyd's has received from the Board of Trade a copy of a despatch from the British Consul at Malaga relative to an atrocious act of piracy committed near the Spanish coast. A short time ago the American barque Reindeer, Captain J. N. Hewlett, master, received a cargo of salt at Cette, for New York. At one o'clock on the morning of the 9th ult. she had proceeded on her homeward voyage to a point about thirty miles to the south-east of Malaga. There two Spanish seamen belonging to the crew surprised and murdered the second mate, the carpenter, the cook, and another seaman, wounded the master, the chief mate, and two others. They plundered the ship of some 400 dols. in specie, and a watch. They stove one of the boats, and absconded with the other one, after setting fire to the vessel fore and aft. At eight am. the American ship Minstrel, and the English brig Susannah hove in sight, and Captain Hewlett and the survivors of his crew were transhipped on board the Minstrel. At six p.m. they abandoned the Reindeer, and very soon afterwards she became completely enveloped in flames. Two of the victims were British subjects. The second mate, John H. Hanson, was a native of Liverpool; and a seaman, Henry Frost Jones, was a native of Cardiff. Both of them were murdered in their berths; the bodies were left on board and went down with the burning ship. The boat in which the pirates quitted the Reindeer has been found on the beach a few miles to the eastward of Malaga.
