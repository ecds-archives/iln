[The American Vessel]
      

The American vessel the Lady Franklin entered Plymouth Sound on Tuesday, and at midnight a fire broke out in her forehold which ended in her total destruction. It is supposed that the fire was wilful, some of the crew being Southerners, and it appears several of them have absconded. Lady Franklin was in ballast.
