[The Gazette of Yesterday Week]

The Gazette of yesterday week contained a notice from Earl Russell that, in the existing state of the civil war in America and the uncertainty which may be felt as to its continuance, the Government has resolved to relax the stringency of those regulations respecting the ships of both belligerents which prohibited them from obtaining in British ports more supplies than were necessary for immediate use, and which required them to leave the port within twenty-four hours after having obtained them.
