New Orleans

New Orleans—There is a charm in the life and society of New Orleans difficult to understand and impossible to describe. "No place like New Orleans," is the verdict of all who have lived there long enough to know what it is; and this in spite of the river that threatens to drown you, and the swamp filled with mosquitoes and alligators; in spite of the yellow fever every three years, and months of every year with the thermometer above ninety degrees. "I had rather be a nigger in New Orleans than own New York and live there," would not be considered a very extravagant assertion in the former city. Whatever may be the cause of the feeling, there is no doubt about the fact. The people are eminently social, generous, genial, and impulsive. The climate during eight months of the year is also indescribably delicious. Roses bloom, bananas ripen, and ripe oranges cover the trees in January. There are little traits of character which may give the stranger some idea of the character of the people. The smallest coin in circulation is the picayune, or five-cent piece. Pennies, or cents, when brought from the north, are used by the boys for pitch and toss, but are of no use in making purchases. Ask a market man if his eggs are fresh, and he will immediately break one to show you, and then throw it into the gutter.—Once A Week.
