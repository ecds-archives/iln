[As the Mayor of New York]


As the Mayor of New York was on a water excursion, one of his children was swept overboard by the boom, but was saved by the master, who jumped overboard, and sustained her until the arrival of the boat. The Mayor presented Mr. J. Munson, her preserver, with a check for 1000 dollars, another of the party giving 250.
