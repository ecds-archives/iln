[The Second Telegraph Line]


The second telegraph line across the continent of America will run by way of Los Angelos and Fort Yuma, and thence nearly on the old southern overland mail route through Memphis or St. Louis. An application is to be made to Congress to allow an extension of the time for erecting the telegraph, which has been delayed in consequence of the war.
