[The Prince of Wales has sent to the Laboratory]

The Prince of Wales has sent to the laboratory at Cambridge University, Massachusetts, a copy of the photographs of the Samaritan Pentateuch taken during the visit of his Royal Highness to Nablous. In presenting this gift the private secretary of his Royal Highness writes:--"The Prince of Wales desires me to add that he will always be glad of any opportunity which may enable him to evince, in however slight a manner, the lively sense which he entertains of the kindness and hospitality he received during his visit to the United States; and that, with these recollections, he cannot fail cordially to reciprocate the wish to which you have given expression, that nothing may occur to interrupt the friendship which ought ever to subsist between the old country and the new."
