[The George Griswold Arrived in the Mersey]


The George Griswold arrived in the Mersey on Monday from New York, with provisions and other supplies for the operatives of the cotton-manufacturing districts. As the ship passed up the river she was welcomed by a salute from the North Fort. Her coming was cordially greeted also by a large concourse of persons. It is proposed to present addresses to the captain, and to acknowledge in other ways the gift of our kinsmen on the other side of the Atlantic.
