Attack on The Confederate Batteries at Bull Run by the 27th and 14th New York Regiments
   

Our Special Artist, who was present at the battle of Bull Run, has sent us some Sketches of the fight and the flight, two of which are engraved on the preceding page. He writes as follows respecting the first Illustration:â€”"About midday the battle raged at its highest. Two of the most gallant charges that I witnessed on the portion of the field where I had taken position, with the first-named regiment, form the subject of the accompanying Sketch. The battery on the right was a flying one, supported by a strong body of Confederate infantry hid in the ravine and in the thicket at the top of the hill. On the approach of the 27th Regiment they hastily retreated to the crest of the rise behind their battery, after firing a volley; and on the Federalists steadily advancing the guns were also limbered up and withdrawn from their position. The 27th lost 27 killed and 69 wounded out of a force of 900 men. On the right the 14th New York are rushing at an earthwork mounting position-guns, but, owing to the galling fire of the Confederate sharp-shooters in the woods and the admirable serving of the pieces in battery, were forced to retire with severe loss."
