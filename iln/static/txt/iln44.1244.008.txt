[Telegraphic Facilities]

Telegraphic facilities are rapidly increasing along the Pacific slope. A line is now being constructed from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon. Workmen are now at work extending the wires from Sacramento along the line of the Pacific Railroad, across the Sierra Nevada, making it, when completed, the third line belonging to this company crossing those mountains. Men are also at work in Carson Valley extending the line westward from this side to meet it.
