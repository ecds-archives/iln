[The Alta Californian Says]

The Alta Californian says the preparations for the commencement of the United States Pacific Telegraph Company's line are completed, and in a few days a large force will commence operations. The new line will have a double wire upon a single set of poles from San Francisco to Fort Kearney, at which point the wires will diverge, one running to St. Louis and the other to Chicago. The total length of the line will be 3270 miles, including both the St. Louis and Chicago branches, and 6040 miles of wire will be required in its construction.
