[A New York Paper States]

A New York paper states that the contract for the dead horses in the Federal army has just been let for 7s. 4d. per head. Last year the contractor cleared Â£12,000. The horseshoes are first pulled off, which are worth about 4s., the hoofs fetch 8s., the tail 2s.; the tallow is not worth much, the hide is worth something; the shinbones are sold to be converted into cane-heads, knife-handles, &c.
