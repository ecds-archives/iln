ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.
Our Special Artist has sent us, as stated in last week's Number, some Sketches in connection with General Burnside's expedition to the coast of North Carolina, two of which are engraved on page 258. He writes respecting them as follows:—"On the first appearance of fine weather I landed on the desolate sands of Hatteras Spit, and started for an island some five miles up, the coast of which was covered with cedars and oaks. Here I made the two Sketches forwarded with this letter. One shows the provisional camp of a portion of the Burnside expedition who have landed temporarily, and the other gives the head-quarters at Camp Winfield of General Williams, who commands the troops that have been in occupation of the place since the capture of the forts."
