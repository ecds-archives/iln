A delegation from South Carolina has had an interview with President Johnson. Governor M'Grath presented a memorial on behalf of Mr. Davis. Mr. Johnson replied that pardons must be proceeded with gradually, and an effort made to execute the law. If treason had been committed it ought to be determined by the highest tribunal, even if clemency should come afterwards. There was neither malice nor prejudice in carrying out that duty, and no disposition existed for persecution or thirst for blood. Expressions of mutual confidence passed between the President and the delegation.
