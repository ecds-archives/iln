ILLUSTRATION OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.
The storm on the Mississippi which forms the subject of the accompanying Engraving occurred on the night of May 20. Our Special Artist, who was on board one of the transports of the Federal flotilla, states:â€”"It was the most violent storm that I have ever witnessed. The lightning flashed in volumes of flame, succeeded by deafening crashes, and, in the instance illustrated, struck into the water close by the ammunition-boat, dashing to the deck the entire watch. The boat in which I was lay next to her, and for a moment we thought, from the concussion, that we had been struck. The ammunition-boat had 25,000lb. of powder on board, besides shell for the entire fleet."
