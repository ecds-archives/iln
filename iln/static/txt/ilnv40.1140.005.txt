The New York Times states that Captain Ericsson's model of a seagoing Monitor, 340ft. long, has reached the Navy Department. It is similar in construction to its little namesake, now lying in wait for the mailed monster, which is momentarily expected from Norfolk. Like that, it has but one propeller and a single turret. The department inclines to favour two propellers and two turrets for a vessel of this size. A board to examine and report upon the numerous plans and models which have responded to the Secretary of the Navy's advertisement has been constituted.
