[The privateer Sumter]
      

The privateer Sumter, after being, as was thought, sighted off Ramsgate, has turned up at Cadiz, where, with the officers and crews—forty-two persons in all—of three Federal merchant-vessels which she had destroyed at sea, she solicited permission to enter the port. The American Consul demanded that this request should be refused, but, the Government having been consulted, the Sumter was admitted into the port without being saluted.
