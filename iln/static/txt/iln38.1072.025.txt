               The particular flag known as the sovereignty flag of South Carolina which that State has recently adopted is represented in the annexed Engraving. It is formed of a red ground, with a dark blue cross, on which are fifteen stars (the central one being much larger than any of he [sic] others), with a white palmetto-tree, and a crescent in one of the corners. This is, we believe, the first flag which has been put forward by either of the seceding States.
               The arms of South Carolina consist of two shieldsâ€”on one a palmetto-tree, supported by two Roman fasces crossed, and two shields hanging on the tree, with the inscription, "South Carolina," and the legend, "Animis Opibusque Parati;" on the other shield a figure of Hope, with the motto, "Dum Spiro Spero Spes." Over all is a figure of Fame, winged and trumpeted; a figure of Liberty is on one side, and a soldier in the old Continental uniform on the other. This coat of arms proper is supported by other figures, representing on one side militia men of one of the cavalry companies of Charleston, and on the other a planter and his slaves. The cotton and tobacco plants are at the base, and the whole is surmounted by a palmetto-tree.
