[The Tide of Emigration]

The tide of emigration from Ireland shows no sign of ebbing. Last week hundreds of people, from the grey-headed grandfather to the child in arms, poured into Queenstown for embarkation in the Louisiana, en route from Liverpool for New York. Hundreds more went by the Inman steamer. Emigration from Ireland to America has totally changed its aspect. The Cork Herald says that "when the tender leaves the pier with its human freight a hearty cheer breaks from the emigrants, which is generally responded to on shore, and a moist eye or sorrowful face is seldom seen among the throng."
