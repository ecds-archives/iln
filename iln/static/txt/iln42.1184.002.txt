[The Alabama had Played a Bold Trick]


The Alabama had played a bold trick. On the 7th of December she intercepted the New York and Aspinwall steamer Ariel, off the east end of Cuba, and took from her 9000 dols. The Ariel was then allowed to proceed on bonds for 228,000 being given, payable thirty days after the recognition of the Southern Confederacy. The result of this proceeding was that on the return voyage the Ariel did not bring the specie from Aspinwall, and the Federal Government had sent a war-steamer to fetch it. The West India mail brings us further intelligence of the doings of the Alabama. Captain Semmes had captured an American barque, laden with provisions, and after having taken on board his own ship so much of her cargo as he deemed necessary, he set fire to the vessel. He had also seized a Federal schooner, but as her cargo was the property of British subjects she was allowed to proceed upon the Captain signing a bond to pay a certain sum of money to the Confederate Government at the close of the war.
