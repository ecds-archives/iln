[Captain Mullan, of the United States Army]


Captain Mullan, of the United States army, commander of the Columbia and Missouri overland route expedition, has returned home after a five years' absence. He has been employed in constructing a military and emigrant road from the head waters of the Columbia River to those of the Missouri, across the Rocky Mountains and through the territories of Washington and Dacotah. The road passes through large tracts of rich agricultural land. Extensive deposits of gold were discovered in the valleys, and iron, copper, lead, and coal were found along the road.
