[The Pacific Telegraph Company]


The Pacific Telegraph Company have erected their wires between the Missouri and the Sierra Nevada, a distance of 1600 miles, and thus completed the telegraphic communication between the Atlantic and Pacific in four months and seventeen days. The company have entered into an arrangement with the Emperor of Russia by which, conjointly, they will construct a continuous line through British and Russian America, across Behring's Straits, and through Asiatic and European Russia, so as to connect St. Petersburg and Washington. This line will be 14,000 miles in length. Russia has already completed 3500 miles and collected materials for extending the wires from Siberia to the mouth of the Amoor, the Mississippi of Asiatic Russia.
