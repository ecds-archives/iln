The Blockade-Runner Lizzie

THE BLOCKADE-RUNNERLizzie.
This steamer has been built, in the Clyde, for the purpose of running the blockade of the ports of the Confederate States of America. The vessels most suitable to this hazardous employment are those of light draught and great speed. The building of such vessels has developed a large trade, particularly among the shipbuilders of the Clyde. The Lizzie was launched a few weeks ago, from the building-yard of Messrs. Henderson, Coulborn, and Co., at Renfrew, near Glasgow. She had been built to the order of Mr. W. C. Deeley, of Liverpool. When completed, she took on board a select party for a short cruise down the Channel, to test her speed. The result of her performances was far beyond the expectations of her builders and owners; it gave the utmost satisfaction to everyone on board. The speed throughout was twenty-two miles an hour, and that was maintained with the greatest ease. This speed is unprecedented in the experience of steam-navigation; no steamer of whatever size having maintained in open channel a speed equal to that of this little vessel. The principal dimensions of the Lizzie are:--Length, 230 ft.; breadth, 22 ft.; depth, 9 ft; about 300 tons gross tonnage. Her engines are on the builders' patent diagonal oscillating principle, and of 150-horse power, nominal. She has feathering paddle-wheels and vertical tubular boilers. The same builders have several steamers on the stocks, intended for the same trade, and all of them calculated for a high rate of speed. Our Engraving is from a drawing by Mr. Hugh Aird.
