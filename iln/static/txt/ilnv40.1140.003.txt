[A Deputation from the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]

A deputation from the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society waited upon Mr. Adams, the American Minister, on Wednesday, and presented a highly-appropriate address to his Excellency. They congratulated him upon being the representative of a Government which was now adopting decided measures to abolish slavery and the slave trade, and they expressed the hope that the restoration of the Union would be founded upon the abolition of "the true cause of strife." Mr. Adams made a brief but suggestive reply. He expressed his sympathy with the anti-slavery sentiments of the deputation, and his trust that as a means of safety the nefarious institution would be extirpated. Upon the subject of the slave trade his reply was equally satisfactory.
