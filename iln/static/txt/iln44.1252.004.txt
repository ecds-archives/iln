[The Steam-ship City of New York]

The steam-ship City of New York, one of the ships belonging to the Liverpool, New York, and Philadelphia Steam-ship Company, usually called the Inman line, remains still fixed upon Daunt's Rock, at the entrance of Cork or Queenstown harbour, where she struck on the morning of Tuesday week. The first of the two Engravings, from sketches taken expressly for this Journal, shows the position of the ship last Saturday, when she presented no external appearance of injury; the tug-boats were alongside removing her cargo, and there was another large steamer, which is seen on the right hand of our View--the City of Glasgow, just arrived from New York, and about to enter the harbour. The unfortunate City of New York, having a hole of ten feet by three in her bottom, and being submerged by high tides above her upper decks, soon became full of water; and our second Engraving represents the midship dining saloon and berths in this condition, with beds, hampers, barrels, and furniture all floating about. We are glad to learn, however, that there is still a chance of saving this fine ship.
