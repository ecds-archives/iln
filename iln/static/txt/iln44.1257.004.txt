IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.
...HOUSE OF LORDS.--Thursday.
Kidnapping for the Federal Army.--The Earl of Ellenborough called the attention of Earl Russell to the kidnapping of her Majesty's subjects in New York.-Earl Russell said that the bounty paid by the United States Government for each man enlisted was as much as 600 or 700 dollars, and unfortunately this was a inducement to unprincipled persons to drug or otherwise keep in their possession sailors and others until they could get them to enlist, and thus profit by the bounty. He was sorry to say that, although Lord Lyons had remonstrated with the United States authorities, his efforts had not been followed by a satisfactory result. It was the intention of her Majesty's Government to make the strongest remonstrance possible in order to put an end to the disgraceful practice alluded to.
