IMPERIAL PARLIAMENTHOUSE OF LORDS.—Monday.

The American Blockade.—Lord Stratheden raised a discussion on the blockade of the Confederate States of America, and was supported in his views of sympathy with the South by Lord Abinger.—Lord Russell replied in defence of the policy of the Government, repeating the arguments with which Sir Roundell Palmer combated the position taken up by Mr. Gregory in the House of Commons on Friday night. The Government of France, he said, had made no representation to her Majesty's Ministers with respect to the alleged inefficiency of the blockade, and he announced it was the firm determination of the English Government to maintain the strictest neutrality between the two contending sections of the Republic.
