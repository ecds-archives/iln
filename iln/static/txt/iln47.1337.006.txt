[A Number of the Fenian Conspirators]

A number of the Fenian conspirators were taken, on Saturday last, before Mr. Stronge, one of the Dublin police magistrates. Mr. Barry prosecuted for the Crown, and stated the case. According to his opening, the designs of the Fenians were bloody-minded enough. They intended a general massacre of the aristocracy, the clergy, both Romish and Protestant, and generally of all above their own class; the land to be divided amongst themselves. Considerable sums of money had been received by the leaders of the movement from America; and the secret manufacture of arms would also, he said, be proved. Stephens, who had escaped, was at the head of the movement. The informer is a man named Nagle. The examination of the prisoners was resumed on Monday, and, after the production of some more witnesses and the reading of documents, Luby, O'Leary, O'Connor, O'Donovan, and O'Keeffe were committed to take their trial on a charge of high treason. Hopper, who was regarded as the financial agent of the brotherhood, was remanded till Monday next. All the prisoners were anxious to repudiate the charge of intended wholesale assassination. Two more arrests have been made in Cork and several in Ulster. At Kingstown, on Monday, a man named Patrick Gaffney was charged with having torn down part of a proclamation offering a reward for the apprehension of Stephens, the Fenian leader. Several districts in the counties of Tipperary, Waterford, and Limerick have been "proclaimed" under the Peace Preservation Act of 1856.
