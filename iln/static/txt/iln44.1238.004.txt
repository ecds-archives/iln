ECHOES OF THE WEEK.
....Englishmen must be wicked in the American eye, and there can be no peace for them or with them. Unhappily, the latest aggravation given comes from our own Government. It is the case of the Victor, an Admiralty ship of six guns, which was sold to some private individual, fitted out by Chatham Dockyard workmen, and finally got clear off, as the Rappahannock, Confederate States' cruiser. Anything more unhappy, more ludicrous, cannot be conceived. Of course, it was never intended, but it looks very much as if our great men were so tired after the labour of delaying the steam-rams in the Medway that there was no more energy amongst them to look after Victors and Rappahannocks. Within a fortnight there will be another supply of the choicest Sewardian scolding, and passionate threats from certain New York organs. And then there will be Lord Russell's reply, and promises, already once broken, never to do the like again. And all this in face of General Grant's standing for the presidency, with a popular "platform," or "ticket," of sworn warfare with England, unless reparation be made for fifty thousand incomprehensible things. The workmen, said to have been officially employed, are all to be dismissed, nominally for being absent without leave; but, in reality, for having been as careless as Government itself in breaking international laws.
