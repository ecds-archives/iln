[A Physician]

A physician, occupying a high official position in Massachusetts, says that since the beginning of the war there has been a remarkable decrease in cases of insanity among women, attributed by him to the various charitable and benevolent operations occasioned by the war, which have excited the sympathies and received the support of women.
