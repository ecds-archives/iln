The Prong-Horned Antelope

THE PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE.
The Zoological Society of London have lately purchased of a London dealer in wild animals the only specimen, it is believed, yet brought to England of the Prong-horned Antelope (Antilope furcifer), which is commonly known in North America by the name of the "Cabree goat." This animal is never found east of the Mississippi, but inhabits the great western prairies of North America, from the 53rd deg. of latitude to the plains of Mexico and California, and was formerly numerous in the country watered by the Saskatchewan River; frequenting the open plains and hills, but never inhabiting the closely-wooded districts. During the winter, however, it migrates from north to south, and returns in the warmer season. It is now becoming scarce in most parts. Its ordinary size, when full grown, is about 3 ft. high and 4 ft. 4 in. long from the nose to the tip of the tail. The body is covered with long hair, which loses its elasticity in cold weather; there is an erect mane upon the neck; the head, ears, and legs are clothed with short, close hair, of a common description. The colour is generally a light fawn colour; except the white stripes across the throat and about the legs and tail. The horns rise perpendicularly from the skull, immediately above the eyes; they spread outwards and are straight till within two or three inches of the points, where they curve suddenly backwards and inwards, forming a small hook; the prong, which is little more than an inch in length, projects from the front of the horn, about half way up from the root; the lower part of the horn, below the prong, is rough and of a flattish shape; above the prong it is round, black, and polished. The specimen now in the gardens of the society in Regent's Park is a young male, which was brought from California to New York, and thence re-exported to England.
