[A Meeting was Held at Rochdale]


A meeting was held at Rochdale, on the 3rd inst., for the purpose of voting the thanks of the inhabitants of that borough to the American merchants and people for the provisions they have sent for the unemployed Lancashire operatives. Mr. Bright addressed the meeting in a speech which was devoted to the subject of the war in America, and to the duty of Britain with regard to that struggle. The hon. gentleman was warmly received.

Negro emancipation meetings have been recently held at Bradford, Stroud, Bury, Leeds, and other towns, at which resolutions expressive of sympathy and approval of the anti-slavery policy of the Federals have been enthusiastically carried. At Bradford more than 4000 persons were present. A resolution was passed at the Bury meeting tendering thanks for the contribution from the Northern States for the relief of the Lancashire distress.
