	  The following intelligence has been received direct from the Southern States. The cotton loan to the Federal Government amounted to 1,000,000 bales on the 6th of September. On that day, the day President Davis was reported to have died, he was at his office at Richmond attending to his official duties. The news is confirmed that the authorities of Spain in Cuba have issued an order to have the same protection extended to vessels sailing under the Confederate flag that is enjoyed by the flags of other countries. At Richmond the estimated loss of the enemy at Manassas is 15,000 in killed, wounded, and prisoners. M'Clennan is closely hemmed in between the lines of Beauregard and Johnson and the Potomac. No importance whatever was attached to the loss of Hatteras. The press in the South is at liberty to discuss public matters freely. The cotton-picking season had fully commenced, and the planters were storing their crops away in the seed on the estates, there to remain at the disposal of Government until the raising of the blockade.
