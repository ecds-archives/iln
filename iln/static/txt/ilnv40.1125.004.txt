Annual Emigration Returns—Extraordinary Falling- Off.—On Wednesday the emigration officials at Liverpool issued their annual returns of the emigration from that port during the past year. At the beginning of the present year, and indeed up to May, there was every promise that the exodus from this port would equal, if not surpass, that of any previous year. In May, however, the American crisis assumed a serious aspect, and the emigration all at once dropped off; and from that period up to the present time there has been a regular and continued decrease, and now the emigration trade of the port is at a complete standstill. Ships that formerly carried out their 500 to 700 passengers can now scarcely raise two dozen—indeed, brokers will scarcely take the trouble of having a vessel surveyed by the Emigration Commissioners, though the expense is trifling. The number of vessels sailing under the Act, or Government supervision, and number of passengers they carried, are as follows:—To the United States, 139 vessels, of 220,213 tons burden, carried 1365 cabin and 26,212 steerage passengers; to Canada, seven vessels, 6720 tons, carried 124 cabin and 1005 steerage passengers; to New South Wales, two ships, 2344 tons, 526 steerage passengers; to Victoria, thirty ships, 49,326 tons, 468 cabin and 9090 steerage passengers; to South America, one ship, 287 tons, 8 cabin and 81 steerage passengers: making a total of 179 ships, and 38,879 passengers. Of ships not under the Act, 348 carried to various parts of the world 6761 cabin and 9387 steerage passengers—16,148 passengers in all. Thus the total number of passengers sailing under the Act was 38,879; and not under the Act, 16,148: 55,027 in all. Of these, 11,591 were English; 20,343 Irish; 2071 Scotch: the remainder belonged to other countries. In 1860 there sailed under the Act 255 ships, 381,650 tons, 2796 cabin passengers and 65,487 steerage passengers, or 68,283 passengers. In the same year there left 15,491 passengers "not under the Act." Another feature of this enormous decrease is, that whereas in former years people made remittances to this country in order to assist their friends "at home" to emigrate to the States, affairs are now reversed, and money is forwarded through agents to bring people from America. The tide of emigration to Australia flows slowly but steadily, and has hardly received any impetus from the deranged state of American affairs.
