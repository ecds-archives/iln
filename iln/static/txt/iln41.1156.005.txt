...British Interests At New Orleans.--Mr. S. Fitzgerald complained that, while France, Spain, and every other maritime Power were represented at New Orleans by ships of war, no similar protection had been afforded to British subjects in that city. The subject was one of grave interest, and the proceedings of General Butler, as well as the possibility of differences between England and America, rendered it important that her Majesty's Government should give their serious attention to the matter.--Sir J. Fergusson having expressed his concurrence in the remarks of the member for Horsham, Mr. Layard insisted that the Government had not neglected British interests at New Orleans. A ship of war had been ordered to that city, but the order was subsequently countermanded, as it was felt to be desirable to avoid any manifestation of power. He added that our Vice-Consul been recognised by the Federal Government.
