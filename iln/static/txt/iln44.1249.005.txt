IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.
...HOUSE OF COMMONS.--Monday.
...Mr. Roebuck made an angry attack on the general policy of Lord Russell as Foreign Minister, and, adverting especially to the intention of the Government to remonstrate with President Davis on the employment of Confederate agents in this country, he wished to know whether representations would be made to the Government of Washington with reference to the enlistment of recruits in Ireland for the Federal service.--Lord Palmerston defended the policy of the Government with regard to the American war, and stated that there was no evidence to show that the Federals were recruiting in Ireland. After some discussion the subject dropped.
