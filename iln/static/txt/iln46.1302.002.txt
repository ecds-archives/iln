[The Cape Papers]

The Cape papers contain voluminous accounts of the cruiser Shenandoah, formerly the Sea King, and her doings. She is commanded by Captain Waddell, and had a complement of about seventy-four men. After taking in her armament and leaving Maderia, under circumstances revealed in some recent law proceedings in England, she had captured and burned five Federal merchant vessels: one she released on finding that the chief owner was a Confederate, and a friend of the captain.
