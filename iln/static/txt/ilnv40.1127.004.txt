THE ADVANCED POST OF GENERAL BLENKER'S DIVISION SURPRISED BY CONFEDERATE CAVALRY.

Our Special Artist in the Federal camp, visiting the advanced posts on the 12th ult., came upon General Blenker's pickets at Auandale, about ten miles from Washington. Whilst he was in the neighbourhood a dash was made at them by a squadron of Confederate cavalryâ€”fine, rough-looking fellows, dressed in nondescript uniforms, red shirts, grey tunics; some with boots and some without; armed with sabres and revolvers. Many of them were very powerfully built, and as they rushed in among the men of the 45th New York they clutched at them and dragged thirteen off at a gallop. Three or four were killed on each side. An Engraving of this dashing attack, from a sketch by our Special Artist, is given at page 61.
