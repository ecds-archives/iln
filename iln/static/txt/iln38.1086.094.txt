               A Novelty in Fire Insurance.—An American paper tells a droll story:—"A clergyman at the West insured his manuscript sermons in the Aetna Insurance Company some ten years ago. In moving into another house, his log hut, in which the manuscript sermons were left behind, was burned. He went to the company for the insurance-money, which was refused, and an action resulted. The defence was that the sermons were valueless. The clergyman produced witnesses who testified that the sermons had done them good, and the jury gave a verdict of 2000 dollars."
