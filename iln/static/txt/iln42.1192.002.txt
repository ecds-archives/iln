The American papers assert that a lady in Syracuse has been married to a soldier in a fort near Washington, the two being 400 miles apart, and the vows spoken by telegraph:--"It took two hours to do the work up complete, and the telegram from the chaplain to the lady, announcing that she and the soldier were man and wife, is the bride's marriage certificate."
