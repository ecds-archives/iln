               The post-office authorities of the United States have just enacted a law that packets of cards, blank or printed, not less than eight ounces in weight, and packets of seeds or cuttings, not more than eight ounces in weight, can be sent through the post at the rate of one penny for two ounces for a distance of 1500 miles, and at the rate of one penny an ounce beyond that distance.
