[The Mail from Sherman's Army]


The mail from Sherman's army, by the Arago, reached the New York post-office at half-past six o'clock on Friday night, and the last of more than 200,000 letters was dispatched by the Erie line at a quarter past four the next afternoon. The stamps not having been cancelled, this labour was necessarily performed in the New York post-office, and employed fifteen men throughout the night and up to noon on Saturday. Twenty men were required to sort the letters. This is the largest mail that the New York post office ever received.
