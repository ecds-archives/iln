[Professor Agassiz Begins]


Professor Agassiz begins, in the last Atlantic, a new series of scientific articles, under the title "America the Old World," in which he maintains that the American continent has been falsely demoninated the New World. "Here was the first dry land lifted out of the waters, here was the first shore that was washed by the ocean that enveloped all the world beside; and while Europe was represented only by islands rising here and there above the sea, America already stretched an unbroken line of sand from Nova Scotia to the Far West."
