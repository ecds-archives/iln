[The Boston (U.S.) Chronicle]

The Boston (U.S.) Chronicle states that the University of Chicago possesses the largest, and it is believed the finest, telescope in the world. Heretofore Harvard College has held that honour, but the "Clarke telescope" of Chicago is to the Harvard as 34 to 21--more than one half larger. Its cost was 11,187 dols. for the object-glass, and 7000 dols. for the tube and mounting. The focal length of the telescope is 23 ft.
