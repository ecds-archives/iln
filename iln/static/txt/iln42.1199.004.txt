[A New York Journal States]

A New York journal states that in some parts of the west Indian corn is extensively used for fuel. Two bushels of corn are considered equal to one bushel of coal. In Nebraska, where the practice of corn-burning is quite common, corn is worth 10 cents per bushel, while coal is worth about 20. Farmers there think it just as profitable to burn one as the other. This is probably the only country in the world where such a destruction of the staff of life could possibly occur.
