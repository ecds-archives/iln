               . . . No case has excited more interest than that of the American negro Anderson, who, flying for freedom, slew the man who attempted to stop him, and, escaping into Canada, is claimed by the authorities of his own State. The majority of the Judges of the first tribunal to which the matter has been referred decide that we are bound to give him up, but the dissentient Judge, in an elaborate speech, took the opposite side, and argued that neither legally nor morally could we be called upon to surrender the man to be burned alive, as he will assuredly be, if yielded up. There is, of course, an appeal, and there will be another, should the Canadian Court of Error not reverse the judgment of the Court below, so that there will be ample opportunity for discussing the case, in which not only is the question deeply interesting as one of morals, but there is a very nice point of law involved. It is, however, felt that in some way or other a horrible crime must be prevented. For England to deliver over that poor man (whose flying from slavery was a laudable action, and whose blow was dealt only to save himself from being captured) to the tender mercies of the now maddened slave-masters would be a blot which no amount of anti-slavery speeches could ever efface.
