               SATURDAY, MARCH 2, 1861.
               . . . President Lincoln will be inaugurated on Monday, and, meantime, has made a brief and pregnant speech, in which he disclaims the ideas of "invasion" and "coercion," but has a definite theory as to the right and duty of the Federal Government to seize its own ports and its own arsenals, wherever they may happen to be situate. This intimation sounds very significantly; and in about a fortnight the arrival of American mails will be watched with painfully-increased interest. We, however, continue to hope that a fratricidal contest may be averted by the wisdom and forbearance of the new President.
