               Tuesday's Gazette contains the Royal proclamation enjoining the observance, on the part of British subjects, of a strict neutrality in regard to the hostilities which have broken out between the United States of America and the Southern Confederacy. The proclamation quotes at length the various provisions of the Foreign Enlistment Act, and then enumerates the several acts which would be deemed an infraction of that statute. In conclusion, British subjects are warned that if they violate the law they will obtain no protection from the penal consequences which may result from their misconduct.
