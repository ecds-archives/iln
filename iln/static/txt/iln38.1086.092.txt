               LATEST NEWS FROM ABROAD.
               The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuter's office yesterday (Friday):—
               America.—Commencement of Hostilitites.—Londonderry, Thursday.—The Montreal Ocean Company's steamer Nova Scotian, Captain Ballantine, from Portland (Maine) on the 13th inst., has arrived here. She landed all mails except those for Liverpool. The New York journals publish telegraphic intelligence from Charleston (which, however, must be received with great reserve) to this effect:—Hostilities had commenced. General Beauregard, on the approach of the Government vessel, demanded the surrender of Fort Sumter. On Major Anderson's refusal Fort Moultrie commenced firing two guns at four a.m. on the 12th inst. Fort Sumpter [sic] replied vigorously. Seven Charleston batteries then operated against Fort Sumter. No particular damage had yet been done on either side. Troops had commenced swarming into Charleston. It was stated that 20,000 men were concentrated in that city. An extra Session of the Southern Confederacy had been summoned. The Southern Government had called on each Secession State for 3000 troops, except Florida, which was to furnish 1500. An attack on Washington was anticipated. The volunteer militia were under arms. The Southern Commissioners have left Washington without having been officially received by President Lincoln. The citizens of the Arizona Territory have held a convention, and have voted themselves out of the Union. The Charleston telegraph wires are said to be entirely in the hands of the Secessionists. Little confidence is, therefore, placed in the telegraphic intelligence received from that city. The Washington militia have been ordered to muster. Advices from Havannah to the 7th inst. state that the Southern Commissioners sailed thence for Europe on the 6th inst.
