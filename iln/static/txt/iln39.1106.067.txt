Discovery of Gold in the Valley of Saskatchewanâ€”
   

	  Letters from the Red River colony, in the Hudson's Bay territory, announce the discovery of a valuable goldfield, by a party of American miners from California, in the north branch of the Saskatchewan. Two Californian gentlemen have recently arrived at St. Paul's, Minnesota, with a considerable quantity of gold, collected by themselves, along the upper waters of the Saskatchewan, and they describe the yield and quality of the metal as promising to be quite equal to that of British Columbia, which occupies the opposite flank of the Rocky Mountains, and may therefore reasonably be inferred to be of a similar geological character, while it is known to be watered by streams which have a common origin in the same auriferous range with the northern tributaries of the Saskatchewan.
