[A Summary]

A summary of the results of the last Census, in 1861, of the United States and of Canada, respectively, establishes the following facts:--That during the interval between the last Census and the preceding one the decennial rate of increase of population in Canada exceeded that in the United States by nearly 5Â½ per cent, Canada adding 40.87 per cent to her population in ten years, while the United States added only 35.58 per cent to theirs. That she brought her wild lands into cultivation at a rate, in nine years, exceeding the rate of increase of cultivated lands in the United States in ten years by nearly six per cent. Canada in 1860 having added fifty acres of cultivated land to every hundred acres under cultivation in 1851, while the United States in 1860 had only added forty-four acres to every hundred acres under cultivation in 1850. That the value per cultivated acre of the farming lands of Canada in 1860 exceeded the value per cultivated acre of the farming lands of the United States, the average value per cultivated acre in Canada being 20 dols. 87 cents, and in the United States 16 dols. 32 cents. That in Canada a larger capital was invested in agricultural implements, in proportion to the amount of land cultivated, than in the United States--the average value of agricultural implements used on a farm having a hundred cultivated acres being in Canada 182 dols., and in the United States 150 dols. That, in proportion to population, Canada in 1860 raised twice as much wheat as the United States, Canada in that year raising 11.02 bushels for each inhabitant, while the United States raised only 5.50 bushels for each inhabitant. That, bulking together eight leading staples of agriculture--wheat, corn, rye, barley, oats, buckwheat, peas and beans, and potatoes--Canada, between 1851 and 1860, increased in her production of these articles from 57 millions to 123 millions of bushels--an increase of 113 per cent, while the United States in ten years, from 1850 to 1860, increased their productions of the same articles only forty-five per cent. That in 1860 Canada raised, of those articles, 49.12 bushels for each inhabitant, against a production in the United States of 43.42 bushels for each inhabitant. That--excluding Indian corn from the list--Canada raised of the remaining articles 48.07 bushels for each inhabitant, almost three times the rate of production in the United States, which was 16.74 bushels for each inhabitant. And that, as regards live stock and their products, Canada in 1860, in proportion to her population, owned more horses and more cows, made more butter, kept more sheep, and had a greater yield of wool than the United States.--Toronto Weekly Globe.
