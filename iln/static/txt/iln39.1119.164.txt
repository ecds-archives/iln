[A number of Americans in London]
      

A number of Americans in London celebrated the recent success of the expedition to the Southern coast by a dinner on Monday night. "It was suggested, and heartily approved, that as General Scott is about to visit this country, he should be entertained at a banquet of loyal Americans and English sympathisers."
