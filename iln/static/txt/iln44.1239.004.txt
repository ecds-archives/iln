The Confederates Quitting Brownsville, Texas.

THE CONFEDERATES QUITTING BROWNSVILLE,
TEXAS.
The town of Brownsville lies on the Texan bank of the Rio Grande (or Rio Bravo) del Norte, about two miles from Matamoros, a town of some note in Mexico, on the south side of the river. Although built almost entirely of wood, Brownsville has a neat and bright appearance. There was a considerable Confederate garrison at this place; but the inhabitants, having, on Monday, Nov. 2, 1863, received information of the arrival of a fleet of Federal transports off Brazos, Santiago, began immediately to evacuate the town; and for two days every means of transit across the Rio Grande was crowded to excess with goods, furniture, cotton, and baggage; while upon both banks were piled in confused heaps bedding, cotton bales, luggage, vehicles, and merchandise of every description. About three o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, the 3rd ult., the military authorities retreated, after burning the garrison buildings, the cotton, and all public stores they were not able to remove. On the 6th ult. the Federals, under command of General Banks, took quiet possession of the place.
