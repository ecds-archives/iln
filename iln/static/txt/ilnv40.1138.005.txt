The schooner Adelaide arrived in Liverpool on Tuesday from Charleston, having successfully run the blockade. She got away on the 3rd of March, and has brought a cargo consisting chiefly of cotton and resin.

At a recent election in Oskaloosa, Iowa, Mrs. Nancy Smith, Democratic, was elected Mayor by a majority of 21 over the Republican male candidate for that office.
