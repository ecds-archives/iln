[The Confederate Cruiser Florida]

The Confederate cruiser Florida is said to have completed her repairs and alterations at Brest, and to be ready to put to sea. Her recent trial-trip was most satisfactory, and she is reported to be in a high state of efficiency. Captain Maurice Richard, her new commander, has waited on the Vice-Admiral of the port and other local authorities to take official leave of them, and no doubt the Florida will sail shortly. The Kearsage, Federal frigate, still mounts guard outside the port of Brest, and a fight is looked forward to with considerable certainty. Captain Richard expresses himself confident of being able to give a good account of himself and his ship, and has, it is stated, written to the Federal commander that he is prepared to accept a combat with him outside the limits of French waters.
