[Captain Pentreath]

Captain Pentreath, of the barque Jessy, of Bristol, has been presented by the Local Marine Board with a valuable gold chronometer watch, bearing a suitable inscription, and chain, which had been received for him by Earl Russell, from the President of the United States. The testimonial was in recognition of Captain Pentreath's services rendered to the captain and crew of the American ship Oberon, when that vessel was wrecked off Cape Horn, on Feb. 12, 1863. The captain, three officers, and fourteen of the crew were saved and taken care of for fifty days by Captain Pentreath.
