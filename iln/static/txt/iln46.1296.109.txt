[There Appears to Be]

There appears to be as large an amount of carelessness on the part of the letter-writing community in America as in the Old Country. The report of Postmaster Dennison shows that 3,580,325 dead letters were received during the past year--over 9000 a day. Many of these letters contained money, deeds, bills of exchange, draughts, cheques, jewellery, and other valuables. Some of them were misdirected, others not directed at all, others, unstamped, and others only partially directed. Thousands of these dead letters were returned to the writers, but the great majority had to be destroyed.
