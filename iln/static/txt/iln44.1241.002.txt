[A Contract for the Construction of a Tunnel]

A contract for the construction of a tunnel, extending two miles under Lake Michigan, at Chicago, for the purpose of supplying the city with pure water, has been awarded; the lowest bid for completing the tunnel being 315,130 dollars. The contract is for a tunnel of five feet internal diameter, lined with brick. The tunnel is to be excavated thirty-five feet below the bed of the lake, and to have four feet of dip landwards. Strainers will be fixed over the outlet to keep out the fish. The total area of the tunnel will be nearly twenty square feet, an area amply large enough to furnish water continuously to a city five or six times the size of Chicago in the present day.
