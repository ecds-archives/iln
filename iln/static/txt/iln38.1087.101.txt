               [An American company of strolling singers]
               
               An American company of strolling singers, called the Alleghanians, gave in December last, in the Island of Hewey, one of Cook's Archipelago, a grand concert, which was attended by the King of the island, Makea. More than 2000 tickets were sold, and the receipts were 78 pigs, 98 turkeys, 116 fowls, 16,000 cocoanuts [sic], 5700 pineapples, 418 bushels of bananas, 600 pumpkins, and 2700 oranges. It required a day and a half to embark all these articles. The concert consisted of a vocal quatuor, and of several morceaux executed by means of bells of different sizes—from the dimensions of a bucket to those of a thimble. The savages who composed the auditory listened open-mouthed, and remained motionless from admiration when the march from "Norma" was performed. At the end of the sitting one of the principal personages present rose, and gravely complimented the performers by saying, " We shall never forget you!"—Entr' Acte.
