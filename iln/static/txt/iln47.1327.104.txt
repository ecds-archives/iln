[The Announcement is Made]

The announcement is made in a Warsaw journal that the long-talked-of scheme for connecting the eastern shores of the Russian empire with the western coast of North America has been so far matured that it has met with the approval and signature of the Czar. The Russian Government agrees to complete the line as far as Nicolajewsk, the American company to continue it from that point to San Francisco, California.
