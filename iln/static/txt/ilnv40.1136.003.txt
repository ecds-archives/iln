IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.HOUSE OF COMMONS.—MONDAY.
...Morocco and the Federal Government of America.—In answer to Mr. Griffith, Mr. Layard said that two officers of the Confederate vessel Sumter, having landed at Tangier, were arrested by the American Consul, and heavily ironed and imprisoned. The Captain of the Sumter wrote to the English Consul, asking him to deliver a letter to the Moorish authorities, and to interfere in the matter, which latter our Consul declined. A Federal ship of war arrived at Tangier, and, having landed an armed force, demanded the prisoners. The Moorish authorities resisted on the ground that by existing treaties between Morocco and the United States they were not bound to deliver up political prisoners, but the Federal Consul threatened to strike his flag, and to declare war against Morocco. He (Mr. Layard) had stated on a former occasion that the prisoners had been released, but that proved not to be the case. They had been transferred from the Federal ship of war to a merchant ship at sea, and transmitted to America.
