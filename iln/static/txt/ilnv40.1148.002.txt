Letters for the Southern States of America

Letters for the Southern States of America.—The subjoined circular, dated Washington, May 21, has been received by the Postmaster-General at St. Martin's-le-Grand:—" Sir,—I have the honour to state, for your information, that the mails are now allowed to pass to and from New Orleans and other places which, having heretofore been seized by insurgent forces, have since been recovered, and are now occupied by the land and naval forces of the United States. It is proper, however, to add that a military surveillance is maintained over such mails so far as the Government finds it necessary for the public safety. I am, &c., William H. Seward."
