Although a small body of Federal cavalry and artillery under General Pleasanton had crossed the Potomac at Shepherdstown, ten miles above Harper's Ferry, the situation of the two large armies on either side of the Potomac remains unchanged.

General M'Clellan officially reports that the total Federal loss in the battles of Antietam Creek and South Mountain was 14,700 in killed, wounded, and missing. From the time when the Federals first encountered the enemy in Maryland up to the time when the enemy was driven into Virginia the Federals have captured thirteen guns and thirty-nine colours--they losing neither guns nor colours. The Federals have collected 14,000 smallarms on the Antietam battle-field. They have likewise captured 5000 prisoners, of whom 1200 were wounded, and have buried 3000 rebels. General M'Clellan thinks that these two engagements cost the enemy at least 30,000 of their best troops. The Richmond Whig has information that the entire Confederate loss at the battle of Manassas was 5000, and in all the engagements in Maryland about 7000.

The Confederate States.

The Confederate Congress have had the emancipation proclamation under their consideration. A resolution has been introduced denouncing it as a gross violation of the usages of war and worthy of the execration of mankind. It must be counteracted by such severe retaliatory measures as in the judgment of President Davis may be calculated to secure its withdrawal or arrest its execution.

The Confederate House of Representatives had finally passed the new Conscription Bill, applicable to all men between thirty-five and forty-five years of age, by a vote of 54 against 29.
