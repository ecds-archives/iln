[A New York Paper Relates]

A New York paper relates the following singular occurrence at the scene of war. A sergeant had been engaged placing upon a number of headboards the names of members of his regiment who had been killed in the late fight. There was one board in excess, and in a sportive vein he placed with a lead-pencil his own name upon it, and the date of his demise, June 20, as his term of service had then expired and he was about to leave for home. A day or two after, while bidding his companions farewell, he was struck on the breast by a 20-pounder Parrott, and instantly killed. The very headboard he had unthinkingly inscribed with his own name was placed ever his grave, which, with date, correctly marks his resting-place.
