               The Fugitive Slave Extradition Case.â€”In pursuance of the judgment passed by the Court of Queen's Bench in the case of John Anderson, the fugitive slave, a messenger of the court proceeded last Saturday from Liverpool by the Cunard steamer for Canada, and Anderson will be brought over to this country unless it so happen that he will be liberated by the Court of Common Pleas in Canada before the messenger shall arrive out. A crowded and enthusiastic meeting was held on the 4th inst. at Hamilton, Upper Canada, to protest against the extradition of the fugitive slave.
