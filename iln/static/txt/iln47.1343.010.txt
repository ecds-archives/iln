[An American Paper States]

An American paper states that Colonel Bulkeley's telegraph expedition has reached Behring's Strait, where the telegraph will cross from America to Asia, and that the Colonel had sounded across Behring's Strait to St. Lawrence Bay. The soundings were favourable all the way across, the bottom being mud. Ground ice was first discovered off St. Lawrence Bay, which was not favourable for the laying of the cable, it being shallow and exposed to the south-east gales. Michigan Bay was found to be full of ice. Package Bay presented a good bottom and seemed suitable for laying the cable, the Asiatic side being more mountainous than that of the American. The country was entirely destitute of timber. The ground was thawed about 30 in. The Indians on both sides were friendly and promised to be useful. The Russians had done everything possible to further the enterprise.
