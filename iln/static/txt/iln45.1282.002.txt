[The Secret]

The Secret, a splendid iron paddle-steamer, has been launched from the ship-building yard of Messrs. Bowdler, Chaffer, and Co., on the Mersey. The Secret is intended for the blockade-running business, and is 230 ft. in length, 26 ft. beam, 11 ft. depth of hold, and 800 tons burden, with engines nominally of 180-horse power.
