The New Fort at Sandy Hook in the Bay of New York

THE NEW FORT AT SANDY HOOK IN THE BAY OFNew York.
We present a View of the new fort lately erected at the entrance of the Bay of New York, near Sandy Hook. It is built with all the recent improvements, and is capable of mounting a very large number of guns. It completely commands the entrance, and would deal destruction to any vessels attempting to pass for warlike purposes. There is scarcely, perhaps, any city in the world better fortified than New York, for, independently of the fortifications, the navigation is most difficult for ships of large draught of water, so that it is doubly secured against invaders. Our Engraving is from a sketch by Dr. Henry J. Rogers, late in the medical service of the Federal army.
