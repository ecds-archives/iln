[Captain Cutting]

Captain Cutting, of the American ship Adelaide, has been presented by the Board of Trade with a valuable binocular telescope for saving the captain and crew of the ship Polynesia, of Liverpool, in December last. When Captain Cutting sighted the ship she was waterlogged, and the crew were reduced to the last extremity, having nothing but a few biscuits to eat and a little rain water to drink.
