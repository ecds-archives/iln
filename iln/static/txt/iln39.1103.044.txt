The Americans have invented an "elevator" for reconnoitring purposes. It is a telescopic tube of sheet iron, raised by a windlass. It can be elevated fifty feet in four minutes, and lowered in one minute; weighs 1700lb., and can be drawn by one horse easily. At fifty feet troops are seen distinctly nine miles; at a hundred feet, fifteen miles. They have also invented an indiarubber "yoke" for knapsacks, which dispenses with the straps, and is said to relieve the burden most materially.
