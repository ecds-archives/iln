IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.
HOUSE OF LORDS. --MONDAY.
...The American Blockade.--Seizure Of British Vessels.--The Marquis of Clanricarde brought forward a motion for papers in regard to the protection of British merchant-vessels in the West Indian waters. In a speech of some length he condemned the conduct of the Federal cruisers in capturing British vessels, and contended that the British Government ought to interfere, even though war should be the result.--Earl Russell denied that the Federals had shown any animus against British commerce. The trade of which the Marquis of Clanricarde had spoken was not altogether of an innocent kind. Representations had, however, been made to the Federal Government against a reckless seizure of ships, and those representations had met with every attention.--The Duke of Somerset also read a letter from Admiral Milne, in which he stated that all the officers who had anything to do with Admiral Wilkes spoke of his courtesy.
