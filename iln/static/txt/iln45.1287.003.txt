[A Statement was Published]

A statement was published some time ago to the effect that Captain Semmes and about 100 of his men had sailed from Liverpool in a vessel called the Laurel, which also took out with her a heavy cargo of munitions of war. This statement was contradicted in the most positive manner; but a despatch has been received in Liverpool announcing that the Laurel had arrived at Funchal, that Captain Semmes was on board, and that that officer and his men, together with the stores taken out by the Laurel, had been transferred to a large screw-steamer, which is, of course, alleged to be a new Alabama.
