We learn by telegram from Lisbon that the American Minister has demanded satisfaction for the firing upon the Niagara and Sacramento by the Portuguese forts after the Federal vessels had signalled that they understood the first signal from the fort. He also requests the dismissal of the Governor of Fort Belem, and a salute of twenty-one guns to the American flag. Madrid papers state that the Portuguese Government has complied with these demands.
