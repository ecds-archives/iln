[Mr. Bright, M.P.]

Mr. Bright, M.P., has received a communication from Boston, U.S., with reference to the probable supply of American cotton this year. The writer says that, after careful inquiry, there will on the termination of the war be 2,500,000 bales available for purposes of trade and manufacture, and then adds, "I regret very much the probable results. The decline in price will seriously impede the reorganisation of free labour and check the production in other countries, perhaps restoring to us eventually too great a monopoly of the supply of cotton."
