The New York Herald announces that Mr. C. F. Hall, the already famous explorer of the Arctic region, has announced his intention of starting upon another expedition about the middle of this month. He will sail first for King William's Land, by way of Hudson's Straits and Bay, on a whaler, the Monticello, Captain Chapel, of New London, and he will be accompanied by the Esquimaux who are Mr. Hall's companions here. The party will make their first winter quarters at Repulse Bay, the extreme north-west of Hudson's Bay. Early in the year 1865 they will make a land journey by dogs and sledges to Boothia and King William's Land.
