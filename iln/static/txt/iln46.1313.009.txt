Governor's Island and Fort, New York Harbour

GOVERNOR'S ISLAND AND FORT, NEW YORKHarbour.
In the last number of our Journal was a View of the new fort erected near Sandy Hook, at the entrance to the Bay of New York. We now give a view of the fortifications upon Governor's Island, which lies within the bay, at the entrance to the East River, or Sound, between Long Island and the mainland. Fort Columbus, Castle Williams, and the South Battery, are the names of the principal military structures upon Governor's Island. The Bay of New York is about eight miles wide and long, and has sufficient anchorage for all the navies of the world to ride with safety in it. The defences of the inner harbour are considered quite impregnable, and they have been made even stronger by the works lately completed, of which the new fort at Sandy Hook is an example.
