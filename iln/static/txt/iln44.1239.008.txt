[The Massachusetts Volunteers]


The Massachusetts volunteers, under the Bounty Act just published by the General Court, will be the best paid troops in the world. The amount of bounty and pay to be received for three years' service, by a soldier who has previously been in the army nine months or more, if he has a family of not less than three persons dependent on his labour for support, is as follows:--United States' bounty, 402 dols.; the Commonwealth's bounty, 325 dols.; pay, 468 dols.; rations, 324 dols.; clothing, 126 dols.; aid to family, 432 dols.--total, 2077 dols. If, instead of 325 dols. in hand from the State, he accepts the offer of 20 dols. per month increase, he will receive 445 dols. of pay more than the sum above.--New York Paper.
