Grant, after visiting the army of the Potomac, returned, with Meade, to Washington, and left immediately for the west. The New York World asserts that Grant has recommended the concentration of forces for the capture of Richmond.
Rumours of General Meade's removal from command are again current at Washington. It appears that Generals Sickles and Doubleday assert that Meade issued an order for a retreat after the first day's fight at Gettysburg. This, however, Meade denies point blank in a letter to Reverdy Johnson, admitting, however, that he had arranged before the battle to take a safer position, and one where he could more advantageously accept battle, and dwelling with particular tenacity upon the point that that could not be a retreat which was to take place without a fight.

The Northern press declares that the orders said to have been found on Dalhgren were forgeries.
