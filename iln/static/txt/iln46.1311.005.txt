[The Boston Traveller States]


The Boston Traveller states that Professor Agassiz is about to undertake a scientific exploring expedition to the tropics, with a corps of eight gentlemen--the most numerous and effective scientific corps that ever went forth--for the purpose of testing the glacial theory suggested by him, which, if correct, would enable the observer to mark, as upon a thermometer, the changes in temperature the earth has undergone. The expenses are defrayed by the spontaneous liberality of a gentleman of Boston, Mr. Nathaniel Thayer, who sent word to the professor, "Select your assistants, organise your expedition, proceed to your work, and send your bills to me."
