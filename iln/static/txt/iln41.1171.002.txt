[Captain Semmes]


Captain Semmes, who achieved such fame as the commander of the Confederate war-steamer Sumter, appears to be doing great havoc among the Federal merchant-vessels in his new ship, the Alabama, or "200." According to intelligence received in Liverpool, he has recently captured and destroyed sixteen Northern vessels, including ten whalers.
