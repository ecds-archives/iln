[Advices from Philadelphia]


Advices from Philadelphia state that the fibre of the plant hibiscos moscheutos is occupying the attention of the merchants at that port as a substitute for linen rags and jute. This plant is indigenous to the Northern States, and grows in abundance in the swampy lands of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, &c. At a moderate calculation, and taking into account the probability of loss from unforeseen causes, three tons and a half of disentegrated fibre can be derived from one acre of ground. Two prominent paper manufacturers of New York have estimated the fibre to be worth 100 dollars per ton, to be used as a substitute for linen rags in the manufacture of paper.-- Liverpool Journal of Commerce.
