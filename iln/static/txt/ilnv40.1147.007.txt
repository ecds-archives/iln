The Slave Trade.—Lord Brougham directed attention to an omission from the recent treaty with the United States of America for the suppression of the slave trade by which the limits of the right of search were not extended to Porto Rico, a coast peculiarly well adapted for the operations of slavers.—Earl Russell said that if it were found necessary to include Porto Rico in the provisions of the treaty he was so confident in the sincerity of the Government of the United States that he had no doubt any suggestion to that effect would meet with attention.
