[A Confederate Ram]

A Confederate ram, the Stonewall (late Olinda) is in great straits cruising about the Spanish and Portuguese coast. The first we heard of her was that she had put into Corunna for repairs, and that the Federal ships Niagara (frigate) and Sacramento (frigate) had taken up their stations outside the port. The Stonewall left last week; but, instead of a fight coming off, we have the following telegram from Lisbon, dated Monday:--"The Confederate ram Stonewall has arrived here from Ferrol, where she left the Federal war-steamers Niagara and Sacramento. The Portuguese authorities have ordered the Stonewall to leave the harbour, and have manned the forts." By a later telegram from Lisbon we learn that the Stonewall quitted the Tagus on Tuesday; and that the Federal cruisers, which had arrived that morning, attempted also to leave the Tagus before the expiration of the term of twenty-four hours required to elapse between the sailing of a vessel of one belligerent and the subsequent departure of an armed ship belonging to the other belligerent. The forts at Belem consequently opened fire on the Federal steamers, and a shot struck the Niagara on the poop and killed a seaman. Both the Niagara and the Sacramento, it is added, then anchored. The Confederate ram Stonewall was built at Bordeaux ostensibly for the Danish Government. She is about 1600 tons burden, has a 12-foot prow, is iron-clad, and is armed with three guns--viz., a 300-pounder forward, and two 200-pounders aft. Her speed is about ten knots, and she has a crew of about eighty hands. The Niagara is of 4582 tons. She has a crew of 450 hands. Her armament consists of fifteen 200-pounders. The Sacramento's tonnage is 1367. She has a crew of about 180 hands. Her armament consists of two 120-pounders and eight 68-pounders. The speed of the Niagara and Sacramento is about twelve knots.
