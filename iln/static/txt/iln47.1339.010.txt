[A New Political Element]

A new political element has appeared in America in the efforts made by the working men to establish eight hours as a lawful day's work. They are holding mass conventions in all parts of the country, and in many places have announced that they will vote for no candidates for office who do not faithfully labour for the eight-hour system.
