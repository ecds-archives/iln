The New York Herald states that the estimated cost of the ship canal around Niagara Falls is five millions and a half. It is proposed to build it from the Head Water to Lewiston, with locks 300 ft. long, 50 ft. wide, and 10 ft. deep. In addition to this, three millions and a half will be asked for the enlargement of the Oswego and Erie canals, and four millions for a canal from the St. Lawrence over to Albany, vi√¢ Lake Champlain; and thirteen millions for an enlargement of the Illinois Canal, from Keokuk to Chicago, so that vessels of 600 tons burden can pass.
