[The New York World Publishes]

The New York World publishes a long and minute account of the secret police system maintained by the Federal Government in that city. It employs 300 officers, besides an immense number of subordinate spies, male and female, and, like the Inquisition, has its own prisons where victims are incarcerated, tortured, and sometimes disappear, leaving no trace. This system, worthy of the worst days of Rome and Naples, costs the Government 50,000 dols. a month.
