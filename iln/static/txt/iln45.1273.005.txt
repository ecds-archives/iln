[The Custom-House Authorities]


The custom-house authorities at San Francisco discovered a Chinese trick, which led to the seizure of another lot of smuggled opium. Among the cargo of the barque Ceres were 400 tubs, invoiced as eggs, value stated at 1 dol. each. The eggs were varnished to preserve them. One of the officers, in examining the eggs, scraped off a little varnish and disclosed a metallic case, egg-shaped, filed with opium. Each egg is worth 300 dols.
