Carolinian Pickets Flying Before the Federal Troops
    
 
The advance of the Federal troops on Fairfax was so rapid that the pickets thrown out by the Confederate army on an obstructed road which the Federals avoided were nearly cut off. They fled precipitately over the obstacles intended to stay the progress of the Unionists. An Illustration of this scene is given on the next page.
