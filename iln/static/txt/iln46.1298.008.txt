Illustrations OfTHE WAR IN AMERICA.General Sherman.
The capture of Atlanta in October last, followed by the march across Georgia to the seacoast, and recently by the capture of Savannah, has made General Sherman one of the most notable officers in the Federal army. We give a Portrait of him and, on the next page, a Map of his route from Atlanta to Savannah. William T. Sherman was born in Ohio, in the year 1818. He entered, when young, the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated in the same class with General Thomas and then obtained his Ensign's commission. He was promoted to a lieutenancy in 1841; and his conduct during the Mexican war in California won him the rank of Captain. Upon the outbreak of the civil war in 1861, he had a fresh opportunity of active service, being appointed Colonel of the 13th Regiment of infantry, which he commanded at the Battle of Bull Run. He was soon afterwards raised to the rank of Brigadier-General and succeeded General Anderson in command of the department of Ohio, from which, however, he was removed because of a difference of opinion between himself and the War Department as to the amount of forces required in the Western States. At the Battle of Shiloh he took so prominent a part that General Halleck reported the victory to be mainly due to Sherman. He was therefore promoted to be Major-General and intrusted with the command of the fifth division of Grant's army, with which he was engaged in the siege of Vicksburg. During the last twelvemonth General Sherman has performed those important operations in the States of Tennessee and Georgia which have made his reputation second to none in the military service of the Federal Government.
