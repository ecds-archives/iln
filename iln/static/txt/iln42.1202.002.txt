[It is Understood (says the Times)]


It is understood (says the Times) that the Government of the United States have resolved to send an agent to this country versed in maritime and international law to co-operate with Mr. Adams, the American Minister in London, in the consideration of the various questions now arising, or likely to arise, on those points between the two countries. The object is to enable such questions in all possible cases to be settled promptly here, instead of their being made the subject of tedious correspondence.
