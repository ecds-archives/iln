[Messrs. Glass, Elliott, and Co., of London, had Proposed]


Messrs. Glass, Elliott, and Co., of London, had proposed to the Federal Government to gird the coast with a telegraph-wire from Fortress Monroe to New Orleans, and to Galveston, if necessary. The joint committee, naval and military, are said to be most favourably impressed with the scheme as developed. Secretary Stanton has written a letter to the military committee recommending the project.
