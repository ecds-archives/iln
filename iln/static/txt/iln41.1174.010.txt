ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.

It was announced in our last Impression that we had received several illustrations in connection with the war in America from our Special Artist at Richmond, Virginia. Some of these appear in this week's Number.

"The Last Stand made by the Federals at Manassas," engraved on pages 516-517, refers to the last disastrous days of the command of the vainglorious Pope, when the Federals were driven back from the Rapidan upon Arlington Heights opposite Washington. Our Artist writes hereupon:--"The Yankee army, towards the close of the day, sought refuge in a gully near the Alexandria and Orange Railroad. For some hours they fought against the Confederates, who used stones and rocks, their ammunition being exhausted. The Confederates kept the Federals off, and eventually remained masters of the field. The Engraving shows the division of General Longstreet charging with the bayonet against the masses assembled to stay the triumphant progress of the Southern arms."

The "View of Richmond from the West," on the same pages, shows the picturesque site of this city, climbing as it does the hills which skirt the north bank of the James River. The railroad bridge given in the Engraving connects the city with its chief suburb, Manchester.

"Drury's Bluff," depicted above, is on the James River. It was here that the Confederate batteries and obstructions forced the two Federal iron-clads the Monitor and Galena to retire to their station at Harrison's Landing. Drury's Bluff is within eight miles of the Confederate capital. The line of stakes planted across the river represents the nature of the obstructions with which the Confederate engineers have covered the approach to Richmond by water.

On the preceding page we engrave the "Camp of the Confederate Marines at Drury's Bluff," stated by our Artist to be one of the most important posts of the Confederates.
