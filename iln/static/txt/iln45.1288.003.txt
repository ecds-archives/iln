[The Great Western]

The Great Western, a vessel bound from the Mersey for New York, was, on Wednesday, stopped when about to take her departure by order of the Custom-house authorities on the plea that she had on board several passengers who had been kidnapped under various pretences to serve in the Federal army. The matter will undergo investigation.
