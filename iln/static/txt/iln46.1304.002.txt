AMERICA.
By the arrival of the St. David (vi√¢ Greencastle) we have received the following intelligence dated New York, Feb. 18, Evening:--
General Grant reports to Mr. Stanton this evening that to-day's Richmond Despatch says Sherman entered and took possession of Columbia yesterday morning. General Beauregard communicated this intelligence officially yesterday. From his despatch it appears that the Federals shelled Columbia on Thursday from the south bank of the Congaree. During the night they moved up the river, and on the following morning forded the Soluda and Broad Rivers. During the Federal passage of these rivers, Beauregard evacuated Columbia. The Federals soon after took possession. Two days previously, when it was decided not to attempt the defence of Columbia, a large quantity of medicinal stores was destroyed. The despatch presumes that the fall of Columbia will necessitate the evacuation of Charleston, which the despatch thinks has already commenced.
The general impression is that Sherman will now proceed to Charleston to establish his base; but the Despatch does not see what need he has of a base. He subsists on the country, and his army has not been exhausted by any battle. Since he left Savannah, Sherman declared his intention to march to Columbia, thence to Augusta, and thence to Charleston. This Beauregard considers was uttered as a boast to hide his designs. The Despatch thinks that he will next strike at Charlotte or at Florence. It was reported yesterday that the Federals had captured Augusta; but the Despatch discredits the report.
The Charleston Mercury announced a temporary suspension on Saturday, with the view to its removal to another point, this being rendered necessary by the progress of military events.

A Confederate flag-of-truce boat has been blown up on the James River. All on board were lost.
