[A Post Office Notice]

A Post Office notice states that there will be no dispatch of American mails this week vi√¢ Galway, as the company have again failed to provide a steamer. The Galway Gazette says:--"The directors of the Atlantic Company have applied to the Post Office authorities for permission to discontinue the mail service between Galway and America until June next. They have also intimated their intention of entering into negotiations with another company for the use of steamers to commence the service at that time, as the ships of the company will not be in readiness to sail even then. The directors are reported to be of opinion that they can never carry out the contract with the ships at present in their possession, and will, in all probability, endeavour to effect a sale of their interest in the project, with a transfer of the mail subsidy to some existing company more capable of carrying out the project. Two or three companies are said to be in negotiation with the Atlantic Company on the subject at present."
