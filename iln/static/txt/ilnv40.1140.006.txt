ILLUSTRATION OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.RECONNAISSANCE BY GENERAL STONEMAN.

On the 14th inst., immediately after the occupation of Manassas Junction by the Federalists, a strong reconnaissance of cavalry and infantry, under the command of General Stoneman, accompanied by the two Orleanist princes, started on the track of the retreating Secessionists. They pushed on as far as Cedar Run, about twenty-seven miles from the junction, driving in the enemy's pickets which they fell in with in the neighbourhood. The subject chosen for illustration in the Engraving on page 403 is the halt of the party and the examination of escaped contrabands (slaves) from Gordonsville, the present head-quarters of the Confederate army of the Potomac.
