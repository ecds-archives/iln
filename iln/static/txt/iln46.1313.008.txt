[With Reference to the Late Confederate War-Steamer]

With reference to the late Confederate war-steamer Tallahassee (built, under the name of the Atalanta, for the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company), of which we gave an Illustration last week, Captain Symonds has requested us to say that he was not the designer of the vessel, but that she was designed, as well as built, by Messrs. Dudgeon, of Millwall, upon a modification of the twin-screw principle, which was held as a patent by the late Mr. Richard Roberts and Captain Symonds, as his representative.
