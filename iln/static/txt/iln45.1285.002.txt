[The Solicitor-General and Mr. Morrison, M.P.]

The Solicitor-General and Mr. Morrison, M.P., addressed their constituents, at Plymouth, on Thursday week. The Solicitor-General alluded to the efforts made by the Government to preserve neutrality in respect to the American war, and especially to enforce the Foreign Enlistment Act. For these efforts he claimed the approval of his hearers. He spoke strongly in favour of non-intervention in foreign affairs, and avowed that his opinions on reform, the ballot, and church rates were unchanged. A vote of confidence in the learned gentleman and his colleague was agreed to at the close of their speeches.
