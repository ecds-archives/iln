[The Gazette of Yesterday Week]

The Gazette of yesterday week contained further correspondence between our Foreign Office and Mr. Adams on American affairs. Mr. Adams, on the part of his Government, declines Earl Russell's proposition for a joint commission, since the American claims on account of the Alabama were to be especially excluded. There is also a correspondence on the Shenandoah, for whose escape and equipment Lord Clarendon declares England is not answerable; and, finally, Mr. Adams accepts the surrender of the Shenandoah, but complains that the men were not put on their trial, to which Lord Clarendon replies that there was no evidence that would warrant their detention for a single day.
