[The New York Times of the 17th Says]


The New York Times of the 17th says:--"Messrs. Clark and Sons, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, have succeeded in making a lens two inches and a half greater in diameter than that of the famous telescope in the Harvard University Observatory. That is about l6 in. in diameter; this more than l8 in. It was made for a college in Mississippi, but the rebellion has annulled the contract. The contract price was about 10,000 dols. It is probably the largest object-glass in the world."
