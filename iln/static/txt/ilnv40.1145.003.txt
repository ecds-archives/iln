LONDON, SATURDAY, MAY 24, 1862.

Beyond confirmation of all the intelligence which we published last week touching the successes of the North, there is not, while we write, much addition to the amount of American news. It is stated that the bombardment of the New Orleans forts had been severe and protracted; but the very small number of the killed and wounded comes, as usual, in ludicrous contrast to the story of the feu d'enfer that lasted six days. General M'Clellan had given evidence of higher strategical powers than those which help the American press to sensation headings of paragraphs; and the tactics which drove a strongly-posted enemy to inglorious retreat from behind fortifications that could have resisted the attack of almost any army that could be brought against them will surely be more admired by real soldiers than any enormous bombardments which a sergeant of artillery would conduct. But such is not the view of the case in the North, and M'Clellan is now abused for having permitted the enemy to be frightened. He would appear to be following them up, and also to be directing operations likely to hem them in. The fall of Richmond was anticipated, with more reason than has gone to the concoction of most of the military prophecies. Unless Beauregard have adopted the system pursued at Yorktown, it is most probable that he and Halleck have met in a battle which promises ample horrors for the vulgar sensation-mongers. The idea that French and Russian mediation is at hand was still prevalent, and the organs of public opinion, knowing neither the facts nor the intentions of the Government, prudently write for and against such interposition, and, for the greater convenience of readers, include both lines of argument in the same article.
