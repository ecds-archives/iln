[British Subjects At New Orleans]
   

British Subjects at New Orleans.â€”A correspondence between Mr. Mure, British Consul at New Orleans, and Colonel Manning, Aide-de-Camp to the Governor of Lousiana, relating to the illegal enlistment of British subjects by the Confederate recruiting parties, was published in Tuesday's Times, and justifies the statement made on the subject by Mr. Russell. A number of cases in which British subjects had been improperly seized are mentioned by the Consul and acknowledged on behalf of the Confederate Government. Efforts appear to have been made, however, to procure the immediate release of such persons where cases were made known.
