ECHOES OF THE WEEK.
....The New Yorkers are, as we have said, busy in their election, just as in the spring we shall be busy in ours. The opinion runs very much in favour of M'Clellan; certainly, his only dangerous opponent is Lincoln himself. The pro-war party depend upon a continuation of the war to the "bitter end" by Lincoln or Fremont; they look to immediate peace at the hands of Vallandigham, and to peace upon a solid basis from General M'Clellan, who, it is believed, will not let the honour of his country suffer....
