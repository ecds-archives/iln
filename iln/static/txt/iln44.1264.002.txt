[The Ship Kent]

The ship Kent, which arrived at Plymouth last week from Melbourne, was boarded on the 24th of April, in lat. 17 S., long. 32 W., by the Confederate steamer Alabama, Captain Semmes. The officer who boarded the Kent reported that the previous day they had burnt the American ship Rockingham, bound from Callao for Queenstown with guano. He said they bad destroyed several other American ships and had a great many prisoners on board.--The Alabama made her appearance in Cherbourg Harbour on Saturday. After being duly authorised by the commandant of the place, she landed forty prisoners, whom the captain said he had taken out of Federal ships destroyed at sea. The Alabama stands in great need of repairs, and is to be permitted to have them done at Cherbourg.
