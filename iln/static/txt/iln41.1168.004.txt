[The Confederates Have Just Sustained a Crather Serious Loss]


The Confederates have just sustained a rather serious loss on our own shores. The steam-ship Iona, which is said to have been purchased by the Southern Government, was leaving the Clyde for one of the Confederate ports with a heavy cargo of warlike stores on Thursday week when she was run down by another vessel and sent to the bottom. The officers and crew were saved.
