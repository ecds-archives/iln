ECHOES OF THE WEEK, AND THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.

...From the very commencement of the American War we have kept an accurate register of the quaint and crabbed words which have turned up in the transatlantic vocabulary, from "stampeding" to "skedaddling," from "bogus" to "bunkum."

An English gentleman, who is said, we know not with what truth, to have been made the victim of a very foolish practical joke on the steps of the Capitol at Washington, and by no less a person than General Halleck, is described as having "wilted." Now, what is "wilting"? Is it another form of "skedaddling," or a variety of "stampeding"?
