THE THEATRES.
...We have received a report of the progress of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean in St. Louis, where their reception appears to have been prodigious. On the 23rd of June Mr. Kean addressed the audience, promising to revisit them in November. On the 27th they appeared in "Henry VIII." and "The Jealous Wife," at the theatre in Chicago, which was filled in every part. The tragedies of "Hamlet" and "Louis XI." have also been performed with Ã©clat. Altogether, they may be congratulated on their success.
