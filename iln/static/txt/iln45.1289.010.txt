[One Pleasing and Hopeful Feature]

One pleasing and hopeful feature in our Canadian colony is the rapid and steady strides with which education is advancing therein. Taking a period of eleven years--from 1850 to 1861, for example--this educational progress appears remarkable, if not unparalleled. Within this comparatively brief time the grammar schools have increased by thirty-one and the pupils by 2500, while the common schools exhibit an increase of 910 buildings and 163,921 pupils. In 1850 the number of free schools was but 252; in 1860 they numbered 2350. The augmentation of attendance at schools is very noticeable, and favourably compares with some of the most flourishing Federal States. During the eleven years specified that increase is in the following ratio:--Pennsylvania, 38 per cent; State of New York, 9 per cent; Massachusetts, 35 per cent; and Upper Canada, 108 per cent. Even in the matter of school moneys Canada takes precedence of those States--the increase for ten years being, in Pennsylvania, 175 per cent; State of New York, 145 per cent; Massachusetts, 68 per cent; and Canada West, 222 per cent.--English America, by S.
