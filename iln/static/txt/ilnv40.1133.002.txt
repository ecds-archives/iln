The Confederate Steamer Sumter was at Gibraltar


The Confederate steamer Sumter was at Gibraltar on the 18th ult., and the Federal steamer Tuscarora in Algesiras Roads. We learn from Madrid on the 25th ult. that the Captain of the Sumter has been arrested at Tangiers at the instance of the American Consul at Gibraltar, and of the Commander of the Tuscarora, who went for that purpose to Tangiers.
