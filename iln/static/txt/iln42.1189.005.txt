[The Steam-ship Gibraltar]


The steam-ship Gibraltar, better known as the Sumter, has again eluded the vigilance of the Federal officers. Some time ago, it is understood, the Sumter was sold to an English firm, and was rechristened the Gibraltar; but, notwithstanding this, she has for some months past been strictly blockaded at "the Rock" by a Northern cruiser, whose commander is alleged to have declared that it was his intention to seize her if possible, no matter what change of ownership might have taken place. By a clever ruse, however, the Gibraltar got safely away a short time ago, and is now lying quietly moored in the Mersey.
