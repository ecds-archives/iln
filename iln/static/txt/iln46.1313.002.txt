[The Detectives at Queenstown]

The detectives at Queenstown arrested one of the passengers by the Edinburgh who bore a resemblance to Booth, the assassin of Mr. Lincoln, and the telegraph carried to all parts of the country the startling announcement that Booth had been captured. It turned out, however, that the unfortunate prisoner was Mr. O'Neil, who is described as "bearing an extraordinary likeness" to the murderer. He has, of course, been set at liberty.
