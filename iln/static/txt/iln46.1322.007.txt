OBITUARY OF EMINENT PERSONS.
...Mrs. Sigourney.
The death of this well-known American authoress occurred at her residence in Hartford, Connecticut, on the 10th ult. Mrs. Sigourney (by her maiden name Lydia Huntley) had attained the age of nearly seventy-four years, having been born on Sept. 1, 1791. In 1819, she was married to Mr. Sigourney, a hardware dealer in Hartford, and a man of much culture and literary taste, and she had by him two children, Mary, the oldest, now the wife of the Rev. Francis T. Russell of Geneva, New York, and Andrew, whose death, a few years ago, was the subject of one of her works, entitled "The Faded Hope." Her first volume, entitled "Moral Power, in Prose and Verse," appeared in 1815, and since that time she has been one of the most prolific American authors. Together, her publications number nearly fifty volumes, many of which attained a very large circulation. A prominent feature in the character of Mrs. Sigourney was her great benevolence. She is said to have made it a point to give at least one tenth of her income to charitable objects.
