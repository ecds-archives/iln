               The Flag of South Carolina
               
               THE FLAG OF SOUTH CAROLINA.—The Charleston Mercury of the 29th of January last says:—"The Legislature last night again altered the design of the State flag. It now consists of a blue field, with a white palmetto-tree in the middle, upright. The white crescent in the upper flagstaff corner remains as before, the horns pointing upward. This may be regarded as final.
