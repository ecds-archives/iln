The Pampero

THE PAMPERO.
This vessel, launched a short time ago from the building-yard of Messrs. J. G. Thomson, Glasgow, has created a good deal of interest, owing to a suspicion being pretty generally entertained that it was intended to make her a consort to the Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Shortly after being launched, the Emancipation Society at Glasgow addressed a memorial to Earl Russell, stating that they had reasons for supposing her to be for that service, and praying for an investigation into the matter. To this Earl Russell replied that the attention of her Majesty's Government had already been directed to this vessel. No interference with the vessel took place beyond posting customs officers near her berth and moving from Greenock the gun-boat Goldfinch, one of the tenders to her Majesty's ship Hogue, stationed there, and placing her on the opposite side of the harbour to the Pampero. Recently, the Lord Advocate of Scotland instructed the customs authorities to detain her, and she is now in charge of a gang of bluejackets. The Pampero is a handsome steamer of 1000 tons, builder's measurement; length, 230 ft.; beam, 32 ft.; depth, 20 ft.; with direct-acting engines of 200-horse power. She is finely sparred, and her main and foremasts, of iron, are capable of spreading a large area of canvas. Her funnel is telescopic. She has lifting screw, and patent reefing topsails. Our Engraving of the Pampero is from a sketch by Mr. Hugh Aird, of Glasgow.
