THE WAR IN AMERICA.
Scene At Fort Moultrie During The Bombardment Of
Charleston.
(From our Special Correspondent.)
The Sketch I send you illustrates one of the most gallant feats in the bombardment of Fort Charleston. I had left my position in Battery Bee and reached Fort Moultrie just in time to witness it. The action was at its height when a ball cut the flagstaff in two just above the traverse, and as it fell it struck a poor fellow on the back of the head, killing him on the spot. The quartermaster of the battalion in the fort immediately sprang forward, and seizing the fallen flag tore it from its hold and leapt on to the traverse, where he stood under the heavy fire immovable, until a jurymast was rigged and raised in the place of the shattered staff. The soldiers in the foreground of my Sketch are removing the broken staff from the body of the poor fellow, who lies beneath it, and who was the only man killed by the Federal fire.
