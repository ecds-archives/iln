               FRANCE.
               The French Government has adopted a similar line of policy to that of England with regard to the struggle now going on in America. Tuesday's Moniteur published an official declaration of neutrality, as follows:â€”
               His Majesty the Emperor of the French, taking into consideration the state of peace which exists between France and the United States of America, has resolved to maintain a strict neutrality in the struggle commenced between the Government of the Union and the States claiming to form a particular confederation.
               The Moniteur also published several articles specifying the measures of neutrality which French subjects are to observe.
