[A Smart-looking Screw-steamer, the Georgiana]


A smart-looking screw-steamer, the Georgiana, arrived at Holyhead from Liverpool for a supply of coals on the 23rd inst. The craft is a tender to the well-known Alabama, and laden with arms and ammunition. She has a crew of sixty persons, all picked men; they are bearded, and most ferocious-looking sea-dogs. She also has a large quantity of tea and other necessaries on board for the Alabama, and carries twenty-eight guns. It is stated that she steams sixteen miles an hour, and is bound for Nassau, her crew having signed articles for that port, and will probably run the blockade to Charleston. She left Holyhead on the 24th.--Freeman's Journal.
