Captain Semmes.


CAPTAIN SEMMES.
The people of the Confederate States of America, who have so marvellously improvised an army and generals to command it, have not been equally successful in creating a navy. The officer who, as captain of the Sumter and Alabama, has most distinguished himself in the naval service of the Confederates is Captain Semmes, whose portrait, engraved from photograph furnished us by Mr. Ferranti, of Sandon-terrace, Upper Duke-street, Liverpool, we give on our first page. Before the secession of the Confederate States Captain Semmes was an officer of a subordinate grade (a lieutenant, we believe) in the United States' naval service. He is a man about fifty years of age, spare in person, and possessed of a large share of activity, so essential for one engaged in hazardous enterprises such as his are.
