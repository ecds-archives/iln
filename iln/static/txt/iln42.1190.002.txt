[The Anniversary Banquet in Commemoration of the Birthday of George Washington]


The anniversary banquet in commemoration of the birthday of George Washington was celebrated on Monday evening, at St. James's Hall. General Vandenbergh was in the chair. His Excellency the American Minister, the Hon. C. F. Adams, in responding to the toast of "The Union," said the the South had entered upon a career, whether for glory or for shame posterity would determine. But, whatever their objects might be, they could not claim George Washington in support of their principles. A strong anti-slavery speech was made by Judge Winter, of Georgia. Among the English guests were the members for Brighton, Professor Newman, and others. The banquet was graced by the presence at the tables of a considerable number of ladies.
