...We observe that Willie Pape, the young American pianist, whose performances have excited so much admiration, not only in London but throughout the United Kingdom, is about to commence a fresh professional tour in the provinces during this autumn. We have often had occasion to express our opinion of the genius and attainments of this youthful and highly-gifted artist, whose reputation is now so well established in this country that there is scarcely a place of any note in England, Scotland, or Ireland where his reappearance will not be most warmly welcomed. We trust that, after this provincial tour, he will resume his brilliant performances in the metropolis, where they have already been recognised as one of the most interesting features of the London musical season.
