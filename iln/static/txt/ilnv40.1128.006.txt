[Commander Semmes of the Confederate]


Commander Semmes, of the Confederate ship-of-war Sumter, writes to the Times, from Cadiz, to defend himself from imputations on the character of his ship conveyed in the report of Mr. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the United States' Navy. "The Sumter," he states, "is a regularly commissioned ship-of-war of the Confederate States."
