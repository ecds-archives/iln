               The Fortresses in the Southern States of America.
               The fortifications on the southern coast are described as follows:— "There are along the coast of the Slave States, from Baltimore to Barrataria Bay, Lousiana, twenty-nine fortifications, that cost the Government 15,000,000 dollars. They contain more than 3000 cannon. This is a good outfit for the Southern revolutionists, added to their ample supply of small arms at the arsenals and armories, which had an increase of 325,000 within twelve months. In addition there are incomplete works at Ship Island, Mississippi River; Georgetown, South Carolina; Typee Islands, Port Royal Roads, South Carolina; Typee Islands, Savannah; Galveston, Brazos, Santiago, and Matagorda Bay, Texas. The guns which were lately stopped at Pittsburg [sic] were designed for those at Galveston and Ship Island. Hampton roads is the great naval dépôt station and rendezvous of the southern coasts, and the only good roadstead on the Atlantic south of the Delaware. Pensacola is very strong, and the only good harbour for vessels of war, and the only naval dépôt on the Gulf. The fortresses at Key West and Tortugas, on the southern part of Florida, are among the most powerful in the world; and every vessel that crosses the Gulf passes within sight of both."
