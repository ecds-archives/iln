War News.

General M'Clellan's head-quarters are still at Harper's Ferry. On the 16th two reconnaissances en force were made across the Potomac by Generals Hancock and Woodbury. Having succeeded in ascertaining the whereabouts of General Lee, the two divisions returned to Bolivar Heights. General M'Clellan concludes his report thus:--"There is no doubt that the rebel Generals intend to give battle at or near their present location. The indications are that they will not have to wait long before they again meet the army of the Potomac." It is, however, stated that General M'Clellan's army is unable to advance on account of short supplies of clothing and shoes for the troops.

The Confederate General Stuart made good his retreat into Virginia, recrossing the Potomac at Edward's Ferry, carrying away 1000 horses and large quantities of boots end clothing taken in Pennsylvania. During this successful raid the Confederates passed entirely round the army of the Potomac. The Confederates have respected private houses, but have torn up the railway tracks and damaged a considerable amount of Government property along their route.

The Southern accounts of the battle of Perrysville, Kentucky, differ from the Northern reports in claiming the victory and capture of 9000 Federal prisoners during the battle.

The Confederates, under General Morgan, captured Lexington, Kentucky, and took 100 prisoners.

The New York Chamber of Commerce has passed resolutions stating that the destruction of the ship Brilliant by the Confederate steamer Alabama is a crime against humanity. The Chamber of Commerce has not failed to notice the change in British sentiments, transforming a friendly nation into a Power the nature of whose neutrality is shown by its permitting ships to go forth and armaments to follow them for the work of plundering and destroying American vessels, thus encouraging upon the high seas an offence against neutral rights, upon the plea of which, in the case of the Trent, England threatened to plunge the American Government into war. The Chamber has heard with amazement that other vessels are fitting out in British ports to continue the work of destruction begun by the Alabama. It is the duty of the Chamber of Commerce to warn British merchants that a repetition of such acts as burning the Brilliant, by vessels fitted out in England and manned by British seamen, cannot fail to produce widespread exasperation in America. The Chamber therefore invokes the influence of all men who value peace and goodwill among all nations to prevent the departure of other vessels of the same character from their ports, and thus avoid the calamity of war. The resolutions close by declaring that it is the desire and interest of Americans to cherish and maintain sentiments of amity with England. Copies of the resolutions are to be forwarded to the British Board of Trade. The captures affected by the Alabama have injuriously affected the freights for American shipping.

Brigadier-General Davis, who recently assassinated General Nelson in Louisville, Kentucky, has been released from arrest, and will probably be ordered to duty soon.

The Democratic party throughout the Free States has taken ground against the emancipation proclamation of the President and against the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
