[Accounts Have Been Received]

Accounts have been received of the wreck of an American vessel, the Thirty-nine States, off the north-western part of Spain, when twelve of her crew perished. She had sailed from Cardiff for Genoa, laden with coal, but encountered a severe storm on her voyage, and was driven ashore near Vigo. The captain and some of the crew got into the boat, but the remainder, twelve in number, were afraid to venture and remained on board. The boat got safely to land; the ship was dashed to pieces.
