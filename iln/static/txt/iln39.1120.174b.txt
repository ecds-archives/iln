[The United States' Navy]
      

The United States' Navy—The statistics of the United States' Navy show ten ships of the line, the youngest of which was built in 1840. Four were still on the stocks, four were at Norfolk when that port was abandoned. There are ten sailing-frigates of 50 guns: two were built in 1797; not one is of 1500 British tons burden; the youngest were built in 1855. There are twenty sloops of from 24 to 16 guns: the youngest was built in 1854. They are too small for their armament. The steam navy is the kernel of the naval force of the Federal Government. It consists of five screw-frigates built, and one building. These are of the Niagara and Minnesota school. There are six first-class steam-sloops. Of these the crack ship is the Brooklyn, 25 guns, and to this class belongs the San Jacinto, 13 guns. There are three paddle-steamers—the Powhattan represents the class; and eight-second class screw steam-sloops and one paddle-wheel—all except the last, built since 1855; they carry from 6 to 3 guns. The third-class screw-sloops, four in number, carry more guns—one 8, the others 5. There are four paddle-steamers, two of 3 guns and two of 1. Three steam-tenders make up the Navy, consisting, on paper, of a total of 10 line-of-battle ships, 10 frigates, 20 sloops, 3 brigs, and 3 troop-ships—all these are sailers; of 6 screw-frigates, of 18 screw and 8 paddle-wheel sloops, and of 3 steam-tenders. The Federal Government has increased the list by 100—merchant ships fitted out to maintain the blockade.
