[Her Majesty's Government]
 

Her Majesty s Government, judging from the papers submitted to them that the seizure of the British steamer Peterhoff by a Federal cruiser was unjustifiable, have intimated that Lord Lyons will be instructed to press for the immediate release of the ship, and also for compensation, if no legal ground of capture can be alleged by the Government of Washington.
