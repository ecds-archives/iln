[The Hibiscus Mosheutos]


The Hibiscus Mosheutos, a North American perennial plant of the order Malvace√¶, has received the name of American jute, from the nature of its fibre, although it belongs to a different order. Specimens of this fibre in various stages of manufacture have been recently laid before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. This plant is indigenous to the Northern States, growing in abundance in the swampy lands of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, &c. A patent has been taken out by Mr. W. J. Cantelo for its application in the manufacture of paper, ropes, and various fabrics hitherto made of cotton. Mr. Howson, who submitted the specimens to the Institute, stated that papermakers had estimated the fibre to be worth 100 dollars a ton as a substitute for rags, and ropemakers declare rope made from it to be equal to that made from hemp and superior to that made from Manilla jute. He enumerated, among other advantages, that the plants required no care after the first year's planting, that the ground they grow on is worthless for all agricultural pursuits, that the machinery required to work it is of the simplest character, &c.
