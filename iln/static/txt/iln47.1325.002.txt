[The Great Eastern]

The Great Eastern, laden with the Atlantic telegraph cable, left the Nore last Saturday evening, and arrived off Valencia on Wednesday morning. The Caroline, with the shore end of cable, twenty-seven miles in length, was detained at Falmouth by bad weather until Monday, and had to be taken in tow by the Great Eastern off Land's-end the same day, and taken to Valencia during a heavy sea. The Terrible and the Sphynx are also off Valencia. In consequence of a heavy rolling sea, the Great Eastern was unable to communicate with the shore, and went for shelter to Berehaven Harbour, Bantry Bay, where she will lie until the shore end of the cable is laid--an operation which will occupy about two days, and which was to be set about directly the weather improved. Once started for the Newfoundland coast, the only danger to be feared is a storm severe enough to drive the Great Eastern from her course. Messages will be transmitted from the ship on paying out each fifty miles, so that the public will be able to watch her course from day to day almost as closely as those on board. On arriving at Newfoundland a message, already prepared, will be transmitted to the directors, and the receipt of this will be considered proof that the line has been opened.
