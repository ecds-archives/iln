[Willie Pape]

Willie Pape, the celebrated young American pianist, gave a "pianoforte recital" at the Hanover-square Rooms, on Friday evening, the 23rd of June, which was under the special patronage of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, and was attended by a crowded and brilliant assemblage. The programme included Liszt's "Grand Paraphrase on Verdi's Jerusalem," Beethoven's Grand Sonata op. 31, Weber's "Moto Perpetuo," Mendelssohn's "Introduction and Fugue," Thalberg's fantasia "The Last Rose of Summer," Benedict's "Where the bee sucks," and several compositions by Master Pape himself. The whole performances were most warmly and justly applauded.â€”Willie Pape has been engaged to give a series of pianoforte recitals at the Dublin Exhibition.
