[A Suspicious-looking Craft]


A suspicious-looking craft, believed to be an American privateer, stopped the Vernon--with a mixed cargo and passengers--on her way home from Sydney to England. A man, who represented himself to be a United States' officer, but who was out of uniform and armed more like a smuggler than a gentleman bearing a Government commission, boarded the Vernon and demanded her papers. These were refused, and on leaving the vessel the "officer" threatened to fire into her. The threat, however, was not carried into effect.
