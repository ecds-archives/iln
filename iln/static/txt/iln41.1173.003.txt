London, Saturday, November 8, 1862.

...The Northern States of America are engrossed with the State elections, which appear to be going against Mr. Lincoln and his party and in favour of the Democracy, which now claims to "command the situation," and which repudiates and denounces the so-called abolition proclamation. The members in course of election will have no constitutional position for a year, but the public opinion manifested by such a reaction as is alleged will have immediate and formidable operation. The war news is almost nil. M'Clellan does not advance; there is a rumour that Halleck is to be removed from Washington to the west, and that M'Clellan is to be succeeded by one who may or may not deserve the title of "the judicious Hooker." The Confederate spoil in Kentucky has been very large, but nothing beyond plunder has been gained by the onslaught. Nashville is stated to be cut off by the Confederates, and the North is still occupied with scolding England in re the terrible Alabama.
