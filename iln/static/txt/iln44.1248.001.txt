FOREIGN AND COLONIAL INTELLIGENCE.
AMERICA.
We have news from New York to Feb. 24. It consists mainly of conflicting rumours. First, we are informed that Sherman had reached Quitman, on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, with a force estimated at between 25,000 and 30,000 men; that he had defeated Polk, near Brandon, and captured 12,000 prisoners; and that Admiral Farragut was preparing to attack the Confederates at Grant's Pass. A different statement, however, is made in the Richmond papers. Those papers assert that the Federals have been repulsed with great loss at Grant's Pass, and that the Federal force at Quitman consisted of about 1000 men employed in tearing up the railroad. Nothing is said, however, about the alleged defeat of Polk. General Longstreet was rumoured to have retired from the neighbourhood of Knoxville, and to have retreated beyond the French Broad River. General Gilmore had returned from Florida to Port Royal, and reported that his expedition had been successful. The Confederates have been twice repulsed in an attack upon the Federals opposite Natchez, Mississippi. General Meade will retain the command of the army of the Potomac during the next campaign.
The Committee of Ways and Means reported back the bill authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to sell the surplus gold, with a recommendation that it be not passed, and that no further action be taken.
The National Executive Committee had nominated Mr. Chase for the presidency, while the Maryland State Union Convention had named Mr. Lincoln.
