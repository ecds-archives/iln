[The Times of India says]

The Times of India says, in its impression of Jan. 29:--"The Confederate privateer Alabama is on our coast. She captured and burnt the American ship Emma Jane off Trevandrum on the 14th inst., and landed the captain and crew at Anjengo on the 17th inst. The Emma Jane sailed from Bombay on the 5th inst., bound to Amherst. The Alabama is now reported to be cruising off Bombay Harbour, lying in wait for the American ice-ship now due, and for several American ships in this port under charter to sea within a few days. It is expected that she may come into port for the purpose of coaling."
