Postage Stamps


Postage Stamps.-We have before our eyes, says the Si√®cle, an example of the rapidity with which an invention is propagated as soon as its utility is recognised. The postage-stamp had its origin in London on the 10th of January, 1840, and for ten years England alone made use of it. France adopted it on the 1st of January, 1849; the Tour-and-Taxis office introduced it into Germany in the year 1850, and it is now in use in sixty-nine countries in Europe, nine in Africa, five in Asia, thirty-six in America, and ten in Oceania. About fifty postage-stamps may be counted in the United States alone. Van Diemen's Land possesses its own; also Hayti, Natal, Honolulu, and Liberia. Lastly, postage-stamp collectors are so numerous a class as to possess a manual and special correspondents ; and the prices of collections at sales are regularly quoted.
