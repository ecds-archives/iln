               A RAILWAY STATION IN THE SOUTHERN STATES OF AMERICA.
               A log-hut, a pile of wood, and a nigger—there you have a full inventory of one of the ordinary country stations on a Georgia or Alabama railway. Our Illustration, taken on the road from Atlanta to La Grange, in the former State, represents only a specimen of its order. The traveller from Charleston to Montgomery, as he jolts and thunders over the single track, will pass scores of these primeval Doric structures, isolated in some black swamp, where the protruding, charred pine stumps alone remind him of the forest long since felled by that brave old woodman, Caloric. As the train approaches the dépôt a person rushes from somewhere with a blazing pineknot, which he brandishes high in air. This dab of lurid light is the Southern substitute for all the complicated apparatus of red and green bulls-eyes, signs, signals, poles, guards, breakmen [sic], switchmen, and watchmen to be met with on a European railway.
