[A Prisoner of War Advertises]

A prisoner of war advertises from Johnson's Island, in a New York journal, for a substitute to take his place in the military prison there:--"Wanted.--A substitute to stay here in my place. He must be thirty years old, have a good moral character, A 1 digestive powers, and not addicted to writing poetry. To such a one all the advantages of a strict retirement, army rations, and an unmitigated watchfulness to prevent them from getting lost, are offered for an indefinite period. Address me at Block 1, Room 12. Johnson's Island Military Prison, at any time for the next three years, inclosing half a dozen postage-stamps.--Asa Hartz."
