[Some Later Intelligence]

Some later intelligence has been received from Captain Hall's Arctic expedition. From Repulse Bay, on Aug. 30, in latitude 66 deg. 31 min. N., and longitude 86 deg. 3 min. W., he wrote to Mr. Grinnell, of New York, that his winter quarters were on the west coast of Sir Thomas Rowe's Welcome, latitude 64 deg. 47 min. N., and longitude 83 deg. 18 min. W., among a community of Esquimaux. Thence he had come to Repulse Bay, and was preparing for his search for the remains of Sir John Franklin's crew; but he made no allusion to his plans.
