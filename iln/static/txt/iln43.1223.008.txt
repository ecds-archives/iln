[A Gold Chronometer Watch]

A gold chronometer watch has been presented by the United States' Government to Captain Robert Clark, Master of the British ship General Neil, for rescuing the crew of the American ship Scargo, on the 15th of March, 1862. An extract from the Scargo's logbook stated that the captain and crew were rescued when their vessel had 5 ft. 8 in. of water in the hold, and when their destruction seemed inevitable.
