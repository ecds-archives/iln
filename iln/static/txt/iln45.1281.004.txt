[A Splendid Album]

A splendid album of oil and water coloured sketches by American artists, valued at Â£300, has been presented to Miss Charlotte Cushman, by the ladies of Philadelphia, as a token of respect and admiration for her talent, but especially as their recognition of the great service rendered by her to the cause of the United States sanitary commission.
