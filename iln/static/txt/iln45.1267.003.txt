[Messrs. Sampson Low, Son, and Co.]

Messrs. Sampson Low, Son, and Co., of Ludgate-hill, have on view a fine impression of a steel engraving by T. Barlow, of London, from a design by the American artist, F. O. C. Darley, having for its subject Washington Irving surrounded by his literary friends. The scene is Irving's library at Sunnyside, and his assembled friends are Prescott, Cooper, Bancroft, Longfellow, Emerson, Kennedy, Bryant, Paulding, Hawthorne, Halleck, Holmes, Simms, Tuckerman, and Willis. The engraving is in the style known as "the line and stipple."
