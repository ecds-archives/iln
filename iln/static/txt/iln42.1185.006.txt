[The American Philosophical Society]


The American Philosophical Society.--The suit of the city of Philadelphia against this corporation, claiming to tax the hall, has been decided in favour of the society. Our readers will be interested in reading the concluding lines of the judgment given by Judge Read:--"The first president of this society was the originator of the first fire company, the first public library, the first hospital, and the first academy, now the University of Pennsylvania; a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Minister to France, one of our Ministers Plenipotentiary who signed the provisional articles and the definitive Treaty of Peace between the United States and Great Britain; and, finally, one of the framers of the Constitution of the United States. This was Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the patriot and the philosopher; and I cannot but express a confident hope that the city and the state of which he was so distinguished an ornament will never permit the hands of the taxgatherer to diminish the fund devoted to the interests of science in every part of the world, both in peace and in war, and belonging to a society of which be was the founder."
