[A Baltimore Paper Says]

A Baltimore paper says:--"Our harbour has been on fire for the last twenty-four hours: literally on fire. The surface of the water for thousands of square yards has been a perfect flame, caused by the destruction of the Italian ship Juliana, which took fire whilst lying at the wharf and loading with petroleum. She had on board 1800 barrels, and had to be towed over to the opposite side of the basin to save the surrounding property. As the barrels burst, the oil spread over the water in a flame."
