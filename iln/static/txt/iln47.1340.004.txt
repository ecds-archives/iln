[The New Opera House Built at Chicago]

The new opera-house built at Chicago, and opened on the 1st of August last, is said to be the largest and most splendid theatre in the world--sufficient to make the Scala and the San Carlo, not to speak of Her Majesty's Theatre and Covent Garden, hide their diminished heads. It was built, at the cost of 1,000,000 dollars, by a single individual, named Hudson, who, having gained in a few years a vast fortune by the manufacture and sale of liqueurs, has erected this theatre to mark his gratitude towards the town to which he owes his wealth. The house, it is added, can hold with ease 5000 persons. The chorus numbers 500 voices, and the company includes the best singers to be found in America.
