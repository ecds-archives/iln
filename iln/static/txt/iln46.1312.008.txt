[It is Impossible to Speak]

It is impossible to speak with exaggeration of the intense grief and indignation with which the news of the assassination of Mr. Lincoln was received in England. In London the feeling was profound. Upwards of sixty members of Parliament signed an address of condolence, which was presented to Mr. Adams, the United States representative at our Court; and on Monday next, as will be seen by reference to our Parliamentary columns, both Houses of Parliament will formally express their sorrow and indignation at the crime. On Monday next a meeting of Americans in London will be held at St. James's Hall--Mr. Adams in the chair. In Liverpool the expressions of grief and indignation were general, and a requisition was got up to the Mayor to call a meeting to give public utterance to the general sentiments. In Norwich, too, and, indeed, in almost every town, similar feeling was shown. In Manchester steps have been taken for calling a public meeting.
