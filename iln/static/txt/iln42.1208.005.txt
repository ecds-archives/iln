THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.
Repairing Damages in The Casemates Of Fort Sumter
On The Night Of The Attack.
(From our own Correspondent.)
After the Federal fleet had retired, which they did about half-past five p.m., working parties from the garrison were told off to strengthen those portions of the casemates which had been damaged. The injuries in every case were only round the openings or embrasures, the piers supporting the arches remaining untouched. Some hundreds of sandbags soon set everything to rights, and the next morning we were ready, anxiously and vainly expecting a renewal of the attack.
