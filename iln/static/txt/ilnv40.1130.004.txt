LONDON, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1862
...Meantime we may record that in the fortunes of the American War there appears to have been, for the first time, a change in favour of the North. An engagement has taken place in Somerset County, in the State of Kentucky, where the Confederates, with a comparatively small force, made a dash to break the line which the Northern Generals seem to be seeking to draw around their antagonists. The fight was protracted, and, as usual, the numbers of the slain are in curiously small proportion to that of the combatants and of the hours during which the struggle is said to have "raged." But at length the death of the Southern General and a decided movement by the overpowering force of the North turned the day, and the Confederates fled, leaving their slain and many of their wounded. The Commander-in-Chief has had other foes to deal with, and has actually been compelled to submit to an examination before a Congress Committee as to his plans of the campaign. It is satisfactory to learn that the intelligent civilians who sat in judgment on General M'Clellan were pleased to admit that he seemed to know what he was about, and certified to the people that there was no cause at present for interfering with the young Napoleon.... Certain of the organs of the South write in rather a despairing way as to the condition of its army; but there is no sign of compromise, and no doubt the strongest efforts will be made to hold out until it can be ascertained whether France and England, or either, will interpose by mediation or by an infraction of the blockade.

A semi-ministerial admission that the three Powers-—England, France, and Austria—disbelieve in the fitness of Mexico for self-government, and that two of them will take an active part in the establishment of a monarchy under an Austrian Archduke, has occasioned considerable "sensation ;" but as the topic must receive ample consideration in both Houses of Parliament it may be well to delay judgment upon this new and bold measure. Were the Northern States at peace, we imagine that so unceremonious a disregard of the Monroe doctrine would rouse a storm which under existing circumstances it may be convenient to postpone.
