Ice Bridge at Niagara.


Ice Bridge At Niagara.--For the third time in the history of Canada the Niagara River at its junction with Lake Ontario has been bridged with ice. The first occasion was before the war of 1812; the second in the spring of 1845. In the latter instance the river, with the exception of very rare and insignificant spots, was bridged over from its mouth to within a short distance of the Falls, and at the wharf at Niagara the boulders of ice were packed on the top of each other to the height of forty or fifty feet, completely shutting out the view of the opposite shore. The third bridging of the river commenced at two o'clock on Monday afternoon, Feb. 16, and at four o'clock some persons crossed. On Tuesday morning a party of seventeen or eighteen, half of whom were ladies, came over from Youngstown to Niagara. The river is bridged with ice from its mouth upwards for a distance of about two miles and a half. The sight is reported as being one of surpassing beauty and grandeur, and well worth a journey to see. The cause of the "jam" is a prevalence of south winds for a few days, and then a sudden change to the north--the first forcing the ice down the Upper Lakes into the river, which is prevented by the north-winds from getting into Lake Ontario.-St. Catherine's Journal.
