[The Engraving of the Lizzie]

The Engraving of the Lizzie, blockade-runner, built on the Clyde, which appeared in our Journal of the 6th of August, was made from a photograph of the oil painting executed by Mr. Samuel H. Fyfe, of 127, Paisley-road, Glasgow, for the builders of the vessel, Messrs. Henderson, Coulborn, and Co., of Renfrew.
