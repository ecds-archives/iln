ILLUSTRATION OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.
Cottonburners Surprised By Federal Scouts.

Our Special Artist writes from Memphis as follows respecting the Illustration on the preceding page:--"The only excitement now in the immediate neighbourhood of Memphis and in South-western Tennessee generally is an occasional collision between scouting parties of Indiana cavalry and the guerrilla bands of cottonburners. I send you a Sketch, the result of one of my scouts with a troop of horse, in which we came upon a party of Southerners on a plantation destroying every bale they could lay their hands on. In the foreground an officer is "hurrying up" the business; one man applies the torch to a pile of loose cotton; others are ripping open and rolling up the bales; while a group of frightened whites and negroes are assembled under the porch of the house. We took two or three of the guerrilla band; the rest scattered and made for the surrounding timber."
