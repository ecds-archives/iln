[Tuesday's Gazette Contains]

Tuesday's Gazette contains an official letter from Earl Russell, formally withdrawing belligerent rights from the ships of "the so-called Confederate States." Any such vessels that may now be in British ports are forthwith to depart, and, for the last time, United States vessels that may be watching them, will be prohibited from doing so before the lapse of twenty-four hours. If the commanders of Confederate vessels wish to divest them of their warlike character they may do so, but at their own risk.
