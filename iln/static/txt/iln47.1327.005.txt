[On Sunday Morning]

On Sunday morning some American and Liverpool detective officers captured a banker's clerk who had run away from America with 100,000 dollars, the property of his employers. The thief, whose name is Townsend, had been traced to Newhaven in Connecticut, to Havannah, whence he went by the West India mail-steamer to Southampton. From there be travelled to Liverpool, and in the mean time two Philadelphia detectives crossed to England by a New York steamer, and, obtaining the assistance of some Liverpool officers, captured their man at the Pelican boarding-house. A quantity of jewellery and 98,000 dollars were found on him. He attempted to draw a revolver, but the officers disarmed him.
