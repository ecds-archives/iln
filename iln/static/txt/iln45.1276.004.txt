View of Petersburg, Virginia, from General Lee's Head-Quarters

VIEW OF PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA, FROM GENERALLee's Head-Quarters.
Our Special Artist in the camp of General Lee has sent us his sketch of a panoramic view of the town of Petersburg and adjacent country, including the camp of General Grant. The Engraving of this view extends twice across two pages of our Paper, the lower half being intended to join the upper half, end to end. We gave some account of the town of Petersburg with our View of that place which was published a fortnight ago. In our present Illustration, though it has been impossible to show the lines of the two contending armies, their relative positions can partly be made out by starting from the tents of the Federal soldiery, which are shown upon a rising ground at the extreme left of the upper half of our Engraving, and following from left to right the indications of earthworks and rifle-pits until they are concealed by the foliage of the wood. At the extreme right-hand corner of the second portion of the view we come upon General Lee, with his staff officers, partly sheltered behind a clump of trees, and watching the enemy's movements through a field-glass. Our Correspondent, writing on the 18th of July, says that the shell-firing from the Federal side had been entirely bestowed upon the women and children, who still remained in the town, and that it had not done the slightest injury to the Confederate troops, who were lying snug enough in their trenches beyond the belt of wood which surrounds Petersburg. The men of the advanced posts on both sides would sometimes leave off shooting at each other, come forward, and have a friendly talk.
