[According to the Last Advices from New York]

According to the last advices from New York, the report of the Commission appointed by the Nary Department, consisting of three chief engineers, who have made careful experiments for five months, showing the practicability of using petroleum or hydro-carbon oils for the purpose of generating steam, has been issued, and proves satisfactory. It is alleged that its use will produce a great saving, not only for merchant steamers, but that a naval steamer can keep the sea under steam three times as long with less labour and greater economy as compared with an equal weight of coal.
