[Lord Lyons]


Lord Lyons left Liverpool on Saturday last, in the mail steam-ship Scotia, for Washington, where he will resume his duties as British Minister. Among his fellow-passengers is Mr. S. Cameron, formerly Federal Secretary for War. There has been a good deal of speculation as to the nature of the instructions which his Excellency carries out with him; but the Globe, in an article written in a semi-official tone, warns us against any impression that an immediate change is to take place in our position as regards the Northern and Southern States, or that "Lord Lyons carries off in his pocket instructions likely to lead to a crisis on his landing." Our contemporary, indeed, has no doubt that "our intercourse with the President's Government will remain as peaceful and uninterrupted as the best friends of England and America could wish." The Times says:--"It is understood that Lord Lyons takes out the most full assurance that, while England will be eager, in concert with other civilised nations, to adopt any step that may tend to promote a permanent return of peace, either through a restoration of the Union on the old or any new basis, or on agreement for a friendly separation, she will meanwhile individually refuse to depart one hairsbreadth from her course of non-interference."
