Burning of the American River-Steamer Isaac Newton

BURNING OF THE AMERICAN RIVER-STEAMER
ISAAC NEWTON.
The Isaac Newton, one of the most elegant of the many floating palaces on the Hudson River, while on her way from New York to Albany, caught fire near Fort Washington, from the bursting of one of her boilers, on Saturday, the 5th ult., and was burnt to the water's edge. All attempts to extinguish the flames proved unavailing. It was impossible, owing to the dense smoke and steam on the lower deck, to get at the hose, and the heat drove the engineer from his post. The Isaac Newton had on board, at the time of the accident, about 130 passengers. A tug and a propeller hastened to the relief of those on board, who were speedily removed from the burning wreck. Fourteen persons were, however, badly scalded by the steam, and of these six died. Our Engraving is from a sketch taken by Mr. Edward L. Henry, of Tenth-street, New York.
