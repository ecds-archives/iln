[A Canadian Journal States]

A Canadian journal states, on information which it has reason to believe is correct, that the number of Canadians who have enlisted in the United States army since the beginning of the war is 43,000. Of this number 35,000 were French Canadians, no less than 14,000 of whom have died on the battle-field.
