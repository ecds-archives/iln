[The New York papers give]
   
 
	  The New York papers give a fearful account of the last hours of a murderer, James White, who was executed on the 15th ult. On the prison authorities going to perform the preliminaries for the execution, they found the prisoner armed with a chain wrenched from the wall of his cell, with which he kept them all at bay for a long time, notwithstanding that hartshorn and chloroform were used to overcome him. In the end he made terms, surrendering for an hour's life, a good dinner, and a drink of whisky; but when on the scaffold he again broke out, and was executed by force, struggling and blaspheming to the last.
