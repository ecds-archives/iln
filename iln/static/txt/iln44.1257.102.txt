[The Great "Lalande" Prize]

The great "Lalande" prize of the French Academy has been awarded to an American mechanic--Mr. Abram Clark, of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts--for his discovery of the companion star of Sirius, by an object-glass (18 in. in diameter) manufactured by himself and intended for the observatory of the University of Mississippi, but since purchased by the Astronomical Association of Chicago for 11,000 dols.
