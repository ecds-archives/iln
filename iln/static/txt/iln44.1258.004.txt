The Companion of Sirius

The Companion of Sirius.--In the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society are recorded some recent observations of this star discovered by the American astronomer, Mr. Alvan Clark. The Rev. W. Dawes says that on March 24 the air was rather thick, yet the image of Sirius was unusually still and well defined, and, although the companion was faint, yet there could be little doubt of its being really a star. After taking some trouble, he was enabled to estimate the distance from the latter to the centre of Sirius to be about ten seconds. On the 25th he was enabled to confirm the reality of the preceding observation. Mr. Lassell gives, in the same periodical, a few measures of the position and distance of the companion obtained by Mr. Marth and himself.
