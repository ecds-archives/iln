               The San Francisco papers say that the richest gold-mines yet discovered are the Pino Alto mines, in the Arezona [sic] territory. They are located on the summit of the Sierra Madae [sic], and are densely wooded with tall pine-trees. Soon after they were discovered, what was a howling waste became peopled with 3000 inhabitants.
