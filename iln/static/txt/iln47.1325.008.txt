[The American Protestant Church at Aspinwall]

The America Protestant church at Aspinwall was consecrated on June 15, the ceremony being performed by Bishop Potter, of Pennsylvania. A large number of the residents of Panama, both native and foreign, including the President of the State, the French Consul, and other prominent inhabitants were present at the service. This is the first Protestant church ever erected on the isthmus of Panama. It is built of stone brought from the Pacific Railroad Company's quarry on the isthmus, and has been erected at the cost of the company.
