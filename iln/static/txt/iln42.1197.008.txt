[Arizona]
 

Arizona, which has become one of the United States, is 30,000 square miles in extent, and was purchased from Mexico for 10,000,000 dols. It is contiguous to the Mexican States of Chihuahua and Sonora. The New York Times states that the menaced schemes of the French in Mexico had the effect of accelerating the admission of Arizona into the Union.
