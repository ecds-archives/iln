[The Following Description of a 'Battery']

The following description of a "battery" recently launched for the Federal service is given in the New York Times:--"The Onondaga is constructed wholly of iron. The hull is 227 ft. 6 in. in length and 48 ft. in width. The frames are of angle iron, 5 in. by 3 in. rivetted to a central plate at the bottom. There is no keel, properly speaking, but a ribbed or arched plating in the place of it, to which all the frames are joined. The lines of the ship are very easy forward and aft, presenting much less resistance than some other ironclads now afloat. There are no projecting armour shelves on the sides, but the vessel is protected from shot by single plates 4 Â½ in. in thickness, bolted directly to the hull. There is no wooden backing of any kind to support this armour, but inboard there is a series of iron knees or angle pieces, secured to the deck and hull, which strengthen it materially, and enable the weight outboard to be carried without straining the ship or making her liable to leakage. The draught of water will be 10 ft.; the rate of speed is not known yet. There are two propellers or screws, one on each side under the stern, each propeller being driven by two engines. The turrets are the same as those upon all the Monitors--11 in. thick in the walls, 9 ft. high, and 21 ft. in diameter inside. There are two 15-inch guns in each turret. The quarters for the officers generally are aft, although some of them--the engineers, for example--have accommodations forward. A great part of the storeage is also aft, including the magazine and spirit-room. Neither the bow nor stern of the Onondaga overhangs the hull, the stern projecting only enough to cover the screws and protect them from damage by shot. There are thirteen transverse water-tight compartments, and the coal-bunkers surround the boilers in addition to the protection afforded by the iron plating."
