The Atlantic Telegraph

THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH.
Things are looking favourable for the Atlantic Telegraph. The shore end of the cable was successfully landed at Valencia on Saturday morning last. Connections were made with the instrument-room at 12.45 p.m., Greenwich time, in the presence of a large concourse. The Knight of Kerry and Sir Robert Peel made congratulatory speeches. Three cheers were given for her Majesty and three for the President of the United States. The paying-out of the heavy shore cable, twenty-seven miles in length, was completed by the Caroline late in the evening. Shortly after four, on Sunday afternoon, the splice with the main cable on board the Great Eastern was completed, and the paying-out began from the Great Eastern. Disquieting rumours were circulated on Tuesday to the effect that the cable was in danger of failure. We are glad, however, to learn that the hitch which occurred had been put right, and that at the time of our going to press all was working smoothly. Telegrams continue to be received from the gentlemen on board the Great Eastern, signalling that the work of laying the cable is proceeding satisfactorily; and this gigantic vessel, herself one of the wonders of the world, which is bearing across the Atlantic the wire that is to make thought simultaneous in the two hemispheres, has so far advanced on her voyage that we may indulge in hopes of its successful issue.
A despatch from St. John's, Newfoundland, states:--"In anticipation of the successful laying of the Atlantic cable a telegraph line has been constructed from this place to Heart's Content, the point selected for the landing of the American shore end of the cable. An office has been fitted up there, and everything that can be done to advance the securing of the shore end of the cable has been performed."
