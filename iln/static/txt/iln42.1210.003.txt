[We Have Received]


We have received from Messrs. Bacon and. Co., Paternoster-row, copies of Hare's Map of the Vicinity of Richmond and [t]he Peninsular Campaign in Virginia; a Topographical Map of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama; and a large Map of the State of Virginia--all published by J. H. Colton, of New York. The first of the above valuable maps is compiled from the official maps of the War Department at Washington, and they will all be found most useful in comprehending the great military struggle of which the States above named form the scene.
