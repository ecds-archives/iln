[The New Haven Journal Says]


The New Haven (U .S.) Journal says that a Captain Davis Hatch, of Norfolk, Connecticut, has returned from a visit to the salt mines at the east end of St. Domingo. He states that there is a mountain there of pure rock salt ten miles long, one mile and a half wide, and 400 ft. high. He has obtained from the Government of St. Domingo a grant for working the mines, and the exclusive privilege for making a railroad from the mines to the port of Barahona, twelve miles distant.
