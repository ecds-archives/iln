[An Atlas of America]


An Atlas of America, illustrating the physical and political geography of North and South America and the West India Islands, has opportunely been published by Mr. Cotton, of New York, and Messrs. Bacon and Co., of Paternoster-row. The maps and city plans, sixty-five in number, admirably executed by George W. Cotton, are accompanied by descriptions, geographical, statistical, and historical, by Richard Swainson Fisher, M.D. At this eventful period in the history of the States, of Canada, of Mexico, and of parts of the southern continent, this elaborate work supplies a great want.
