Mrs. Lincoln (says the Chicago Republican) is living in perfect seclusion at the Hyde Park Hotel, on the shore of the lake, seven or eight miles from that city. Both her sons reside with her. Captain Robert Lincoln is studying law in the office of Messrs. Scammon, M'Cagg, and Fuller, in Chicago, and goes there daily, by the Illinois Central Railroad, to attend to his duties.
The New York Shakspeare Memorial Committee are ready to receive designs for the monument, which is intended to be a full-length representation of Shakspeare, conforming in face and costume to the monument at Stratford-on-Avon and the Droeshout print prefixed to the first edition of his works, these being regarded as the only trustworthy authorities. The sculptor must be a United States man.
The United States Pacific Railroad Telegraph line will be completed from Chicago to San Francisco in one year from the present time. Twelve hundred miles are already under contract, to be completed in 1865. This will make the second telegraph line to the Pacific, one being already in operation.
