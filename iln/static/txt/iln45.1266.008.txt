The American Mail Steamer at Roche's Point

THE AMERICAN MAIL STEAMER ATRoche's Point.
Every reader of the London morning papers is accustomed at the present time to look for some exciting news of the American war in that column of large type and short paragraphs which is headed "By Electric and International Telegraph, vi√¢ Roche's Point," with the name, perhaps, of one of the Cunard line of steamers, which may be half way up St. George's Channel, on her way to Liverpool, at the moment when this intelligence meets the reader's eye. We have engraved a Sketch of the Scotia lying off Roche's Point, at the entrance of Queenstown Harbour, where she is met by one or two small boats, to bring the telegraphic despatches to land, when not a moment is lost in transmitting their message by the electric wire to London, Liverpool, and every other place concerned in obtaining the earliest American news. At the same time, a portion of the mails are taken by the Jackal tender, which is also shown in our Engraving, and conveyed up the harbour to be forwarded by railway from Cork.
