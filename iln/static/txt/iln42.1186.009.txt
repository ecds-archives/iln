[General Tom Thumb]


General Tom Thumb is about, for the tenth time, if puffs are to be believed, to be married. Mr. Barnum has announced to the public of New York that the future bride of the famous homunculus is Miss Lavinia Warren, twenty-one inches high, and granddaughter of General Warren, who was killed at the battle of Bunker's Hill. As the diminutive couple can in future only be exhibited to "the crowned heads of Europe," the beneficent Barnum offers the New Yorkers a final opportunity of attending the General's lev√©es at the American Museum, and at the small charge of twenty-five cents a head.
